The iPad 2 was my first re-entry into the mobile computing world beyond a smartphone.</p>\n<p>For a long time, I tried to adapt the work I needed to do on a mobile computer to the iPad platform. I went through the iPad 2 and then onto the iPad 3. I took them to Taiwan and Europe and used the camera connector kit to backup and view my photos from my SLR. I took them to class to take notes in lectures. I took them to work to take notes and keep organised.</p>\n<p>What I learned was that the full size iPads (9.7 inch models), were not made for people like me. It doesn’t hurt to have one - it never does - but if I could have only taken one of either a OS X device or an iOS device for my non smartphone needs, for me, it would have been a difficult choice.</p>\n<p>Until now.</p>\n<p>Computing on a MacBook is now insanely great.</p>\n<p>The new line of Retina MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs released in 2013 with the Haswell 4th generation processors makes choosing between a MacBook vs an iPad a much fairer choice.</p>\n<p>The iPads no longer have the trump cards of size/weight and battery life. Haswell has made that a much more even playing field. Add on the power saving improvements in OS X 10.9 Mavericks…and the battery life on these MacBooks is now truly “all day”. 10 hours on the 13-inch Retina Pro and 13+ hours on the 13-inch Air.</p>\n<p>To be fair, the iPads have caught up on their shortcomings too. The iPad Air and Retina Mini are now fairly beast-y when it comes down to computing power.</p>\n<p>The comparison can now pretty much be solely made on the preferred operating system as the gap between everything else has been finally closed to a point where they are small trade-offs rather than deal breakers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (late 2013 model) and iPad","date":"November 03, 2013","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-11-17-Post-PC/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Post-PC"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013-10-30-Mobile-computing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mobile computing"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5fe5f669-cc38-5999-9981-bfb8e1c50365","previousPostId":"6f194061-0b43-5549-8faf-bf4d82030565","nextPostId":"3f40daf1-af8a-5e4b-9aab-14cc036d5828"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
