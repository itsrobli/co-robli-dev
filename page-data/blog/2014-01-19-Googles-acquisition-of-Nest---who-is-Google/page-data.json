People are, however, biased towards particular behaviour due to their life experiences.</p>\n<p>I think life presents you with certain choices that include compromises and people (Google) make the best choice they can with what they know at the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html\">Google announced</a> on 13 January that it would acquire Nest for $3.2bn.</p>\n<p>I think this is a significant indicator of Google’s strategy.</p>\n<p>I need to state two broad stroke premises:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google is an advertising business which uses it’s core competency of large scale machine learning technology to target ads at a level of accuracy not previously possible before the internet revolution.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nest.com/about/\">Nest</a> is (was?) a business focused on bringing traditionally “dumb” home products into modern times by making them “smart”<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. Their core competency is an experienced team making great products (led by Tony Fadell the “godfather” of the iPod) and proven with the Nest Thermostat.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are some theories regarding why Google acquired Nest given Google’s business does not require it to produce physical products end to end (in the same way e.g. Apple does).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google’s giant machine learning technology wants data from your home (via Nest) to get even better at predicting what you want and delivering that information to advertisers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stratechery.com/2014/googles-new-business-model/\">Google is trying to become good</a> at being a products company to diversify it’s current advertising business given its growth is highly correlated with the growth of internet usage which is predicted to peak in the next few years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think there are many good points raised in the diversification argument, however, I see it as a side benefit. I find the acquisition to be quite in line with Google’s current business model.</p>\n<p>Just because internet usage is set to peak, doesn’t mean Google will peak with it. Google will still have its core competency - a giant pool of human behaviour data and probably the best engineering team in existence to decipher that data and produce products and information based on that data. I think it’s narrow minded to think this core competency won’t be valuable beyond an advertising business.</p>\n<p>I personally don’t think Google is evil - selling your personal data to advertisers. I think that is currently a necessary compromise to achieve a greater goal. I think Google’s aim is to build great products off the back of its core competency - it’s just that this core competency takes a long time to develop and nobody on earth has the money and risk appetite to fund such a project.</p>\n<p>Think of it as you will, Google is currently an ad supported giant R&#x26;D project.</p>\n<p>Advertising and sponsorship are currently the only ways to bring products to market without customers/users handing over cash. Most of the time, it’s the best choice to keep bringing great products into the world.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean Google’s business will always be advertising. If anything, this acquisition of Nest should be viewed positively that Google is maturing into a products company no longer reliant on ad money.</p>\n<p>That would be an exciting thing.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Smart i.e.connected; creating an enjoyable interaction process with the user by learning to predict the user’s behaviour where possible and providing an enjoyable UI where not. </p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google's acquisition of Nest - who is Google","date":"January 19, 2014","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-01-27-Happy-birthday-Mac/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Happy birthday Mac"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-01-11-Everpix-releases-data-gold-mine-for-startups/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Everpix releases data gold mine for startups"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"96e8d107-f0f2-54d2-9cbd-3a81e5880b6c","previousPostId":"7f3a753d-1b01-5de7-ad1d-c4a4ebba5e03","nextPostId":"d32050d2-99e1-5881-b748-4d7d9da020ad"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
