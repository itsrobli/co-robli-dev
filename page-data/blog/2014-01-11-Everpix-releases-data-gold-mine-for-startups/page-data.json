It includes everything from financial data about their operations to pitch slides to venture capital firms.</p>\n<p>They have done a huge service to almost anyone looking to start their own business by releasing such detailed intelligence - especially software developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here are some example of common startup questions this dataset helps answering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are investment terms for consecutive convertible notes and an equity seed round? What does the end cap table look like?</li>\n<li>How does a Silicon Valley startup spend its raised money during 2 years?</li>\n<li>What does a VC pitch deck look like?</li>\n<li>What kinds of reasons do VCs give when they pass?</li>\n<li>What are the open rate and click rate of transactional and marketing emails?</li>\n<li>What web traffic do various news websites generate? (see here and here)</li>\n<li>What are the conversion rate from product landing page to sign up for new visitors?</li>\n<li>How fast do people purchase a subscription after signing up to a freemium service? (see here and here)</li>\n<li>Which countries have higher suscription rates? (see here and here)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most interesting data I found (in the short 10-20 minutes I spent looking) is evidence supporting the proposition that people who used Everpix loved Everpix. You can see below the retention rate of paying users is at almost 100%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2014/01/retention.png\"></p>\n<p>I feel it is a great shame that Everpix couldn’t raise the money they needed. It wasn’t a lot in the grand scheme of things (especially when considering what garbage is funded nowadays).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Everpix releases data gold mine for startups","date":"January 11, 2014","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-01-19-Googles-acquisition-of-Nest---who-is-Google/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google's acquisition of Nest - who is Google"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-01-04-The-Nerd-Handbook/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Nerd Handbook"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d32050d2-99e1-5881-b748-4d7d9da020ad","previousPostId":"96e8d107-f0f2-54d2-9cbd-3a81e5880b6c","nextPostId":"8d20d154-36d8-5540-953d-14dede87e925"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
