I can store all of my media on one drive (connected to my router) and access all of it from my desktop, laptop and TV.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"PS3 Media Server (freeware)","date":"June 02, 2010","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-06-08-iOS4-vs-iPhone-4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"iOS4 vs iPhone 4"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-06-01-Snapshot-and-ahalf/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Snapshot and a half"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"378223a4-e60f-5c6d-9854-e7a25e1249e7","previousPostId":"2d929a5d-a4a5-5bbc-a82e-dcc584261f16","nextPostId":"b49ea3b7-e662-56b6-84ab-dd0b0eca16c8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
