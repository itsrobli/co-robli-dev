Just some thoughts from the day:</p>\n<p>I completely agree with the notion that practice is everything as every time I take some photos I learn a great deal.</p>\n<p>During a simple stroll around Manly at sunset, I learnt a lot about how using different exposures can help capture colours.   Along with this, the importance of manual mode when the camera’s metering system fails and using the correct  focus points.  I was able to capture the colours in the images below without any post processing adjustments.</p>\n<p>I also noticed that I think a lot more about what i want to capture now and not just snapping randomly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2010/10/img_0897-2010-07-17-at-17-04-44.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The image above shows that if I speed the shutter speed up, I can cut out enough of the bright light so the subtle colours can come through better.</p>\n<p>The images below show that, as always with photography, there is a trade-off as to what else you want to capture and how well exposed they are.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2010/10/img_0894-2010-07-17-at-16-59-01.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The photo above could have had the buildings blacked out even more, with more of a silhouette look, given the details in them are really not important.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2010/10/img_0905-2010-07-17-at-17-08-40.jpg\"></p>\n<p>As opposed to the image above, where the colour of the sky and rock pool come out well but I wouldn’t mind slightly more detail in some of the other areas as I think the overall image looks a little too dark.</p>\n<p>I didn’t get a chance to try any polarising or other colour adjustments with the photos I captured, but I feel they might add something, but I’m not quite sure what else I want to add.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Manly 17 July 2010","date":"October 25, 2010","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-11-14-2010-Australian-InternationalMotorShow/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2010 Australian International Motor Show"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-10-18-Event/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Event"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fe0767e6-5eed-510f-91a2-ec3afe52117e","previousPostId":"77154aa6-975b-543d-a649-8a99e40d7e45","nextPostId":"c3a5e26c-013e-5be4-8242-57308e768b04"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
