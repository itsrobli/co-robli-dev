Technically, I think I was ok.  The light was disappearing fast and I could perform that well under some mild pressure.  Composition was decent and saved with some cropping.  Posing was the real victim, obviously an area for improvement as I this was the part that came least naturally.</p>\n<p>I can imagine if I was doing a shoot of a stranger I’d have to build rapport and get to know them on top of everything else.  I’ve still got a ways to go. Loving the journey though.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2011/05/20110515-170537-_rli1541-9-20-08-48.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Li Photography\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2011/05/20110515-170014-_rli1527-6-20-08-48.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Li Photography\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2011/05/20110515-170840-_rli1544-12.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Li Photography\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2011/05/20110515-165126-_rli1511-8.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Li Photography\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"One light","date":"May 16, 2011","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-05-23-The-ambient-light-strobe-and-long-exposure-experiment/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The ambient light, strobe and long exposure experiment"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-04-25-On-the-pier-at-Paradise-Beach/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On the pier at Paradise Beach"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ac6955f-b4bf-596f-90e1-8017a94fd026","previousPostId":"4d81cf57-5063-58c3-8415-e9034e79dcc6","nextPostId":"d21f3e7b-cbbf-5a55-8ef8-0419ef8217c9"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
