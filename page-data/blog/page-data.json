It allowed me to get hands-on with modern JavaScript, React, and GraphQL.\n\n- I am interested in data and analytics and in particular how it can be more accessible with better tooling. In 2020, I co-wrote [this article][1a]. I am a fan of using Python and SQL for data analytics.\n\n- In 2018 and 2019, I experimented with machine learning [here][16] and wrapped it in [Django to demo][16b]. I originally deployed the Django app on a VPS and manually configured and managed the web server and database server (I won't do that again).\n\n- In 2019, I played around with stat models [here][16a] to predict the 2019 AFL season because I haven't played/followed footy since school but I wanted to take part in the tipping comp. Overall, it performed ok but notably did 100% accuracy in one of the rounds.\n\n- In 2014, I made Timely, a time recording web app for use at work. It allowed my teammates to conveniently track time they spent on projects for billing and costing purposes. I built it as a simple CRUD web app using PHP without any app frameworks. It was the first app I made and I learned a lot about authentication and data capture.\n\n- In 2014, I made [Where To][1], an iPhone app that finds a place nearby to go to when you're out with friends and everyone's response to \"where to?\" is \"I don't mind, anywhere is cool with me.\" I wrote it in Objective-C and used Google's Places API to find interesting places. I am still maintaining this app for iOS changes. It doesn't make any money or have any users but I enjoy keeping informed about the Apple development platforms.\n\n- In 2014, I had a list of suggestions of places to eat in NYC from a recent trip. Along with my photos from the trip, I wrapped it up in some HTML, CSS and JavaScript and called it [New York City Eats][2]. I hadn't made a website since using HTML, [marquees][2a], and frame in 1997 - it was interesting to say the least.\n\nPhotos and videos\n\n- You can see my photos [here][5] and all over [my blog posts][6] and [websites][7].\n\n- In 2015, I made this video reviewing the [Apple Pencil][17] when it was first released.\n\n- In 2011, I photographed a [wedding][8] and [engagement][9].\n\n- In 2011, I worked with [Vantage Interactive][3] on [this little ad][4] for the UNSW School of Mining Engineering. I did the majority of the video editing.\n\n\n## Technical\n\nI made Version 2 [of this website][20] using [Gatsby][21].\n\nI made Version 1 [of this website][10] using [Middleman][11]. It's a static site generator and uses many of the tools from the [Ruby][12] web development world.\n\nYou can verify my ownership of this domain on [Keybase][19].\n\n\n[1a]: https://platform.deloitte.com.au/articles/transform-your-data-with-dbt-and-serverless-architecture\n[1]:\thttps://robli.org/where-to/\n[2]:\thttps://robli.org/nyc-eats/\n[2a]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee\n[3]:\thttp://vantageinteractive.com.au\n[4]:\thttps://youtu.be/tD-A73i4UM4\n[5]:\t/photos\n[6]:\t/blog\n[7]:\thttps://robli.org/nyc-eats/\n[8]:\t/blog/2011-12-01-Wedding-Sandy-Raph/\n[9]:\t/blog/2011-12-22-Engaged-Wendy-Nicol/\n[10]:\t/blog/2015-08-23-a-new-website-and-10-years-on-the-mac/\n[11]:\thttps://middlemanapp.com\n[12]:\thttps://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\n[13]:\thttps://twitter.com/itsrobli\n[14]:\thttps://www.instagram.com/itsrobli/\n[15]: https://github.com/itsrobli\n[16]: https://github.com/itsrobli/depreciation-rate-classifier\n[16a]: https://github.com/itsrobli/afl-tipping-poisson\n[16b]: https://github.com/itsrobli/kv-depreciation-rate-classifier\n[17]: https://youtu.be/RP-18X8IR5s\n[18]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsrobli/\n[19]: https://keybase.io/robli\n[20]: /\n[21]: https://www.gatsbyjs.com\n[22]: https://apps.apple.com/app/know-time-zones/id1626299302","fields":{"source":"assets","slug":"/about/"},"frontmatter":{"date":null,"title":"About","description":null}},{"excerpt":"I believe privacy is important.

Japanese design…","body":"\nEver since I found out about Japanese toothpicks - I have been watching out for other interesting Japanese designs. \n\nJapanese design, particularly of every day objects, is something I find pleasing. Good design promotes efficiency as a social norm. In a society like Japan where people live in dense areas, and time is so scarce, these cultural norms are extremely important for cities to function.\n\n## The care is in the details\n\nI started with the humble toothpick. \n\nThe Japanese toothpick is designed so that the end of it can be easily snapped off. \n\nThis indicates this commodity object is now someone’s property. \n\nBut most interestingly, the newly snapped-off end can now be used to lift the toothpick off the table so it can be re-used.\n\n![tootchpicks yo!](/images/2016/01/jap_des_01.jpg)\n\nThis type of thinking about eating utensils extends to soup spoons as well. The spoon that comes with ramen has a little hook at the end that stops it from falling back into the bowl.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_02.jpg)\n\nThere are many examples of minor conveniences - all adding up to reduce overall friction. Recycling bins next to vending machines. Machines to check you in and out of hotels. Parcel delivery to the airport rather than your hotel. \n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_03.jpg)\n\nThe existence of these little things all indicate a culture where people think things through. Everything is designed with intent right down to the minor details.\n\nAnd along with conveniences, there is real efficiency gains that are achieved. \n\nBelow is a queue area for a bank teller which has an overflow area across the path way. \n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_04.jpg)\n\nHow often do you have to walk around a queue of people, just standing around, in Sydney?\n\n## A cohesive society - precedure and order\n\nThis is a diagram at a metro train platform that tells you which carriage you should use to be closest to the exit at every station along that train line.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_05.jpg)\n\nAnd then clearly marked is where you should line up so you are simultaneously close to your train carriage door but also not in the way of people exiting the train.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_06.jpg)\n\nAs a small aside, if you catch a bullet train, you will see the train guards performing this ritual. I researched that they do this because pointing at the items you are checking reduces human error. This dance looks ridiculous to an outsider, but it demonstrates the commitment to following well thought-out procedures with precision and purpose.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_07.jpg)\n\nThere are also important conveniences for people who use wheelchairs and need the lower buttons (at every lift I used in Japan).\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_12.jpg)\n\nThis dedication to order and procedure extends to eating as well. Everything has its place.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_08.jpg)\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_17.jpg)\n\n\n## Other tidbits\n\nThere is always somewhere to put your bag. \n\nIn restaurants…\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_09.jpg)\n\n…and toilets. And yes, they’re extremely clean toilets! - I saw people using the shelves and hooks all the time.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_10.jpg)\n\nHeated mirrors so you don’t have to wipe it off after a shower.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_11.jpg)\n\nI thought the signs were rather amusing (and often sexist).\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_13.jpg)\n\nSome are just so detailed even foreigners can figure it out.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_14.jpg)\n\nOther times, they’re just whimsical…\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_15.jpg)\n\n…but often, functional. Why put a solar powered light here, because you need it…and you can.\n\n![](/images/2016/01/jap_des_16.jpg)\n\n## Bad design - why Sydney trains run late when it rains, when the sun is shining, when there is a breeze, when somebody coughs...\n\nIf you need an example of bad design, just get on board a Sydney Cityrail Train.\n\nYou will experience the common phenomenon of seeing the person boarding in front of you stepping onto the train and then suddenly freezing in place. \n\nAfter a good 5 seconds, they move into the train.\n\nThen as you recover from almost walking into them (and stopping the queue of people behind you), you step onto the train, you look up, and you suddenly freeze too.\n\nThis ritual repeats itself as each person boards the train. The freezing is more common amongst the non-frequent commuters and tourists.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe complete list of possible places to sit/stand after entering a Sydney Cityrail Train:\n\n1. Left\n2. Left crevice\n3. Forward\n4. Forward left crevice\n5. Forward right crevice\n6. Right downstairs\n7. Right upstairs\n8. Right in between up and down stairs\n9. Right crevice\n10.

Start  by thinking about the outcome you want, then figure out the how. The common mistake is to instead look at the skills and resources available, then figure out what can be created given those constraints.\n\nI had 3 goals for this new website. \n\n1. I want the site to be fast. \n2. I want it to be cheap to run. \n3. I want all my [stuff][2] to live in a central hub I control. \n\n---- \n\n## 10 years on the Mac\n\nThe Macintosh is an example of a product where the people who made it first thought about the outcome, the user experience, then figured out the technology (like [rounded rects][3]) that were required to get there.\n\nThe process of building this website reminded me of all the reasons why I love the Mac. All the tools I need are easily available - either pre-installed, or a simple `brew install $WHATEVER` [command][4] away.\n\nFor example, OS X runs on top of Unix. The open web is usually some flavour of Unix[^1]. Developing for the web on the Mac is a joy because most concepts and commands are the same (e.g. file systems, permissions, tools like `rsync`). Everything feels native and familiar. When I open up the Mac terminal app and SSH into my web server it’s the same environment I’m familiar with on my Mac. [Ruby][5], [Apache][6], ￼[Bash][7]￼…it’s just all there and it’s all the same.\n\nThe past 10 years on the Mac have been the most creative of my life simply because there is so much support out there for making things on the Mac. Beyond the tutorials, the available apps are best of breed and usually open-source. I learned photography, video editing and programming all on the Mac.\n\nI hope the Mac and OS X continue to evolve and stay true to themselves[^2].\n\n---- \n\n## It’s just some implementation detail, don’t worry about it…\n\nExecution [is everything][8].\n\nThis site is far from great. But I believe a lot of the fundamental architecture and design decisions are *ok*.\n\n### Solving for outcome 1 - speed\n\nThe problem with the web in 2015 is it’s slow and bloated. Many popular sites are full of ads and tracking that make pages load slowly, suck your phone battery dry and blast noise from autoplaying videos you don’t want to watch.\n\nYou can see below from a simple test I did on the [SMH][9] homepage I found 22 trackers active - a lot of them are advertising related. These trackers each fire off their own scripts and make additional network requests - often running long after the main webpage has loaded - chewing up battery life unnecessarily.\n\n![][image-1]\n\nI did two things to tackle this problem.\n\n#### Scripts\n\nFirstly, this site runs as little JavaScript as possible. This is an easy decision for me because I don’t need to make money off this site.\n\nI do run some JavaScript where it’s needed. However, I do not put any scripts in the `<header>` of the HTML because I don’t want anything taking priority over the rendering of the content.\n\nI like to use footnotes in my blogs to add little bits of info[^3] but I don’t like the traditional method of linking to footnotes at the bottom of an article. It makes for a bad reading experience to have to jump up and down within an article. I use [bigfoot][11] to show the footnotes in a pop-up. The traditional footnotes are still at the bottom. As with any JavaScript library, [jQuery][12] is also required. What can you do[^4].\n\nIn addition, I also run [Google Analytics][13][^5] to track what’s happening on this site. You can read about some of the privacy implications [here][14].\n\n#### Static site\n\nA lot of blogs use a CMS like [Wordpress][15]. I like Wordpress. My [previous effort][16] ran on Wordpress and I have been using it for almost 10 years. The problem with Wordpress is that I believe a CMS is overkill for a blog. There is no need for a server to put together a blog post for the user every time a page is requested. The page is going to be the same for every visitor!\n\nBuilding once and serving the same page to everyone is a better approach for a site like mine. This way, my server[^6] is only sending raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript to each request which is retrieved directly from the server’s file system. This minimises work done by the server which speeds up the overall request/response cycle. As a side benefit, this also bypasses many security issues that can arise from having a database backend.\n\n*But* I don’t want to craft every single page like an animal - programming can help with that.\n\nI built this site using [Middleman][18] which is a static site generator. It programatically pieces together each page and every possible permutation of a page. That way, I can build once and then deploy.\n\nMiddleman is quite capable so far, easy to use[^7] and very customisable. It has dedicated blogging tools and plenty of modules to add-on functionality later. \n\nSome tidbits about the design:\n\n- I designed the site from the ground up and wrote a lot of custom CSS to get it looking how I wanted. The foundation is [Bootstrap][19] so I didn’t have to worry too much about mobile vs desktop rendering and sizes.\n- Why orange? I wanted the background to be white because I wanted images to blend easily into the page. I didn’t want the usual boring blue highlight colours so I opted for orange which goes well with white, I think.\n\nAs a great side benefit of the static site approach, it means there is significantly less demand on the server’s resources and hence only minimum computing power is required bringing down costs and brings me to the next outcome required…\n\n### Solving for outcome 2 - server running costs\n\nMy choice in using a static site also results in minimum server requirements. \n\nI am using a [VPS][20] that costs $5/month with 512MB of memory and uses SSDs for storage. SSDs are fairly cheap now in a VPS environment, and given the limited memory, the storage performance must be top notch.\n\nThe VPS also hosts all my other content from the [robertwli.com][21] and robli.org domains.\n\n### Solving for outcome 3 - central hub\n\nI find the web is moving to a place where everyone’s content is stored and owned by private companies like Facebook, Google and Apple. This in itself is not a bad thing. They provide great services.\n\nI am a believer in the power of the open web. A web where you control, store and serve your own content over the internet.\n\n#### My projects\n\nMy [About][22] page lists all the stuff I have worked on past and present. Hopefully, I will keep adding to this page as I tackle new projects.\n\n![][image-2]\n\n#### My photos\n\nI also finally have a [place for my photos][24] that I’m fairly happy with. Ironically, I started to learn programming because I was not happy with any of the templates the typical photo portfolio websites offered. After getting side-tracked with programming for 2 years, I circled back to the original task.\n\nI will be adding progressively to this as well.\n\n<img className=\"img-hero\" src=\"/images/2015/08/roblico-photos-section-combined.jpg\" />\n\n\n[^1]:\tusually linux\n\n[^2]:\tAfterall, it’s the existence of the Mac that allows the next generaiton of computing devices like iOS devices to have the freedom to stay simple and be true to themselves.\n\n[^3]:\tlike this\n\n[^4]:\tOn the bright side, chances are you already have 4 different versions of jQuery cached on your computer.\n\n[^5]:\tWhy?

He also designs icons. \n\nHe is 14 years old.\n\nThere are a lot of \"kids\" doing this kind of thing nowadays.\n\nOutside the population of people paid to do these things, I would bet less than 10% of the working population over the age of 40 would have any idea how to do these things to even a basic level of skill. I would also bet that % figure rises fast as the age group becomes younger.\n\nI have drawn a fun[^1] illustration of this concept below:\n\n![][image-1]\n\nThis 14 year old's skills have an important place in future economies. \n\nI believe these skills, and others we currently regard as specialist skills, will become trivial skills in the future. The only unknown is when.\n\nThink about the skills you have that you use at work every day. Which of these are skills that:\n\n- No employer would pay extra for (i.e. are expected); and\n- Are useful; and\n- Once were the domain of specifically paid workers.\n\nI can think of photocopying, typing, managing schedules, managing digital content, taking the elevator to the correct floor, making coffee.\n\nThese are all skills now considered so trivial that everyone is expected to do as part of their daily routine[^2].\n\n## A little bit of background\n\nWhether we take a salary or run a business, we are \"hired\" for a \"job\" to be done. A \"job to be done\" is a \n[useful framework][2] to help understand what motivates and drives the business transactions underpinning the economy. Customers buy things, and businesses hire people because they find themselves with a problem they need solved.\n\nEmployees acquire skills and business operators apply these skills to solve the customers' \"problems\". These skills may be advanced degrees or acquired through work experience. \n\nProblems get solved in new ways all the time.\n\nNew products enter markets because they solve problems in a better way (e.g. cheaper, easier or quicker)[^3]. \n\nAs a consequence (or as a cause depending on the circumstances), businesses devise new or better ways to do things - requiring less employees or those with a different mixture of skills.\n\n\n### A little bit of illustrating\n\n\nBelow, I've drawn conceptually how salaried jobs/roles evolve over time:\n\n\n![][image-2]\n\nFor example, accounting and financial forecasting used to take \nages. It used to takes ages and required an army of people. Educated people. Expensive people.\n\nBusinesses used to hire MBAs to model fancy financial concepts - and these MBAs could do it, they just needed an army of people recalculating every number whenever an input changed (which was often)[^4]. Businesses used to also hire armies of accountants, pencilling in entries into giant ledgers (made of paper[^5]). \n\nThen these machines started popping up - [Apple II's][3] with [VisiCalc][4] to be exact. Spreadsheets! \n\nSpreadsheets made these tasks orders of magnitude quicker and as a result requiring less and differently skilled workers. Then, as computers became easier to use, spreadsheets quickly went from a specialist skill, to basic junior level work, to an expected skill. The operator transformed from a skilled analyst, to a macro button pusher and then into an [ERP system][5] generated report. The ERP systems are now all cloud-based[^6] and can be hosted and used anywhere by anyone, or, one day, by no-one at all.\n\nSo what we've seen over the last 30 years is that most of this work has been automated or offshored or done by one person when there used to be three.\n\nThe problem is still there. The job is still being done. The solution is just different.\n\n\n### Finally to my point\n\n\nThere are salaried jobs out there that one day everyone will be expected to do. There are even more jobs out there that will decrease in value and will be outsourced to the cheapest bidder. \n\nThese are the exact same jobs we currently think need \"professional\" training and expertise. The only thing we don't know is which jobs and when. Some will make this transition over the next 5 years, others, 25 or 50 years. Given we are all living longer lives, there is a high chance we will experience these transitions. Some of us already are. \n\nSome already have.\n\nWe have seen this happen to the automobile industry and more recently to the publishing industry.\n\nThe transition is slow and the signs are not obvious. It's easy to attribute your salary freeze or company's decline in sales to the economy. Yet, at the same time, a Google engineer's starting salary is $100,000, the Dow Jones closed at a record high of \\~18,000, and the revenue growth of Google, Amazon and Apple is phenomenal.\n\nThese businesses are not in new markets. Advertising, retail and consumer goods have been around for a very long time. These business are simply approaching the \"job to be done\" in a new way. New ways that require new skills. \n\nThese examples are also not unique. Just look at the \n[steady stream][6] of businesses starting up. Most are just solving old problems in new ways; and the few brilliant ones are solving new problems, creating new markets.\n\nHaving my professional skills become worthless one day is the one thing that scares the shit out of me. \n\nOne way to stop that from happening is to have substantially more useful skills than a 14 year old.\n\n\n### Optimism\n\n\nSteve Ballmer quips \n[here][7]:\n\n> Salespeople at Microsoft are naturally optimistic, probably everywhere. Just tell us where to go and we're gonna run! And I know we're gonna succeed! Because people want to believe. Engineers, you say, here's where we're going to go, and the first thing they say is, oh, come on. \n> \n> That's not right. That's not the right way to go. But I have found - and this might belie my fundamental optimism - that the engineer's optimist is sometimes a little different than the salesman. **While the salesman just says, where to go, charge, the engineer likes to say, the world is all screwed up, but I can fix it. That's an engineer's optimism to me. Everything's-- but I can fix it**\n\nTo 2015.\n\nCheers.\n\n![][image-3]\n\n[^1]:\tOr not so fun. \n\n[^2]:\tUnless you bring in enough business to have the budget for a personal assistant (who you probably now share with 5 other people). \n\n[^3]:\tOnce in a while, products create entirely new markets because they solve problems that people didn't realise existed or thought couldn't be solved. \n\n[^4]:\tLet's not even go into error rates. \n\n[^5]:\tFor the kids out there.\n\n[^6]:\tMagical puffs of magic and unicorns. \n\n[1]:\thttp://www.ccard3.com\n[2]:\thttp://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/\n[3]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II\n[4]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc\n[5]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning\n[6]:\thttp://www.crunchbase.com/funding-rounds\n[7]:\thttp://youtu.be/7lhlKF6MECs?t=21m33s\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2014/12/20141231_jobs_to_be_done_graph_perc_of_ppl.png\n[image-2]:\t/images/2014/12/20141231_jobs_to_be_done_over_time.png\n[image-3]:\t/images/2014/12/20141231_jobs_to_be_done_over_time_future.png","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2014-12-30-Jobs-to-be-done/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"December 30, 2014","title":"Jobs to be done","description":null}},{"excerpt":"There are currently two tech trends of note: iPad sales growth was astronomical for the first few years but over the last few quarters…","body":"\nThere are currently two tech trends of note:\n\n1. iPad sales growth was astronomical for the first few years but over [the last few quarters growth has slowed noticeably][1].\n2. Microsoft is putting a lot of effort into their Surface line being [currently marketed as the perfect tablet-laptop hybrid][2] and it’s finally starting to [get some interest and make some money][3] for them (although some [have pointed out][4] that they’re still $1.7bn in the red overall on that product line).\n\nI think iPad sales stagnation is a direct consequence of its functionality stagnation. The iPad fills niches very well (like for people who don’t like/need/never experienced a desktop operating systems), however, what you can do on a tablet that you can't on a smartphone has stagnated and many people are still not convinced they need it when they already have a smartphone.\n\nAt the same time, there appears to be interest in some sort of device that is more powerful than a tablet but just as easy to use. Something that is as easy to use as a touch based operating system whilst still powerful like a “traditional” keyboard + mouse/trackpad operating system.\n\nI think such a device needs a whole new user interaction model[^1].\n\nThe current two interaction models are quite distinct and I don't believe the solution is simply taking a little from column A and a little from column B. I don't think anyone has figured it out yet (or necessarily ever will).\n\n## The Surface: hybrid device but mostly just crap\n\n![][image-1]\n\nWhen the original Surface was released along with Windows 8, my opinion was that it was poorly executed because it didn't solve the hard problem of the user interaction model[^2].\n\nInstead of being the *best* of both worlds, the Surface ended up being the *worst* of both worlds.\n\n- Any aspect of it that was better than a tablet was completely outweighed by it being too heavy and thick.\n- You had to deal with a soft-touch keyboard and kick stand. Both were things trying to solve problems that already had solutions.\n- The touchscreen-keyboard hybrid interaction model was implemented very badly. A sign of bad design is that there are choices for the user when instead the designer should have just figured out the best solution. Windows 8 was the epitome of this with a desktop version of an app and a touch version. It was like someone tried to present the best bits of both then then just gave up.\n\n## Convergence is a user interaction model problem\n\nThe real problem with a hybrid device is that the user interaction model has not been figured out yet. Microsoft is dabbling in the middle, at the crossroads, and failing. Apple and Google are focusing on their touch and desktop OSs and working out how they can [better integrate][5] (not converge).\n\nA tablet is good not just because it’s small and light but because the touch interface is intuitive. A laptop (or desktop PC) is not just a good device because it’s powerful[^3] but because the keyboard and mouse/trackpad are a dynamic combination offering precision and speed (hotkeys/shortcuts) that can’t be replicated on the touchscreen.\n\nThe hardware problem of the first Surface/Windows 8 products were inevitably going to be solved; the user interaction model problem was not. Having something small, light and thin was never the problem stopping laptop and tablet convergence. It’s not a hardware technology problem. It’s not difficult to put a touchscreen in a laptop or make a touchscreen stand in front of you. The original Surface [had fans][6] and was bulky and as generations have progressed it has become more refined[^4]. This trend will continue when Intel releases in mass quantities its delayed Broadwell processors, the Surface (and all laptops really) will take on slimmer form factors and [lose their fans][7].\n\nThe difficulty as Steve Jobs [correctly said][8] is that touch screens \"don't want to be vertical…they are ergonomically terrible\".\n\n![][image-2]\n\nThe problem is each existing user interaction model doesn't work well with the other form factor. More specifically, touch does not scale up well into complex environments; and keyboard + mouse does not scale down well into intuitive environments (as we have seen over the last 30 years).\n\nMore specifically:\n\n- It is tiring swiping at a laptop screen that is sitting vertical in front of you when you have a keyboard on your lap.[^5]\n- It is frustrating using a tablet and having to copy/paste repeatedly without a keyboard.\n- It is almost impossible to do fine adjustments on screen without a mouse[^6].\n\nOn the other hand, it can be very confusing dealing with a desktop operating system - a touch/mobile operating system can be much more intuitive to use.\n\nEach user interaction model needs to be true to themselves because they don't scale well beyond themselves.\n\n## The likely future is not convergence but a evolved tablet\n\nI think that the tablet is going to get better at doing the 95% of things that 95% of people need to do on a computer before someone is going to figure out the user interaction model of a truly great tablet-laptop hybrid.\n\nIt’s going to be a good enough replacement for 95% of people and they won’t need a desktop operating system anymore. We are likely to see these evolutions over the next couple of years. Things like:\n\n- Easier to understand file system abstractions (the iCloud model of the file lives with app was an attempt but it fails for many reasons).\n\n- More elegant inter-app communications that doesn't just give the user a big list to pick which app the user wants next.\n\n- More intuitive interfaces for multi-tasking. Side-by-side windows may be one obvious answer but not a very good one (especially looking from the point of view of the proverbial grandparent). It introduces a whole new class of problems like: how does an app decide how big it needs its window to be? how does the user override this? will the controls for closing/resizing \"windows\" be on-screen and if not how will they be accessed?\n\nAll of these things will evolve and get to a point where most people will see their tablet as beyond something they just watch videos or read the web on. It will become a truly productive and creative machine. This will be all achieved by having better system software and by having better apps.\n\nThe tablet can't be stuck at the crossroad like the Surface, it needs to decide what it wants to be. Otherwise, it will cease to exist. The smartphone will eat its bottom end and the laptop will eat the top end.\n\nIf we're speaking in terms of tablets being [post-PC product][9], then I think its quite clear the hybrid products currently on the market are not post-PC products. They are really just very advanced laptops with some touch goodies sprinkled on top. This is exactly what makes them crap. The laptop will instead succeed by being true to itself and Google and Apple are taking this direction in their own interesting ways.\n\n[^1]:\tI don’t know if this is a phrase or not but I’m runing with it. \n\n[^2]:\tThis is as true for the Surface as it is for third party OEM products from Toshiba, Asus, Lenovo, etc \n\n[^3]:\tCommand line, keyboard shortcuts, multi-tasking, etc \n\n[^4]:\tOnce you put fans inside anything it ceases to be a tablet. It's as simple as that. \n\n[^5]:\tI watched someone do this on the train to work and I got tired just from watching. Type type type -\\> swipe, tap -\\> type type -\\> swipe…. \n\n[^6]:\tAlthought software has handled this problem very well by presenting big dials for fine tuning. \n\n[1]:\thttp://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/tim-cook-on-ipad-sales/\n[2]:\thttp://youtu.be/YfpULoEZIHk\n[3]:\thttp://www.anandtech.com/show/8642/microsoft-q1-fy-2015-financial-results-record-revenue-on-strong-consumer-sales\n[4]:\thttp://www.citeworld.com/article/2461707/tablets/microsoft-has-lost-about-17-billion-on-surface-so-far.html\n[5]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite#Continuity\n[6]:\thttps://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+Teardown/12842#s44058\n[7]:\thttp://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/the-pc-at-ifa-part-2-mini-desktops-and-thin-fanless-broadwell-tablets/\n[8]:\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNVsn1P4GlM\n[9]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-PC_era\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2014/10/Surface-Press-02-623-80.jpg\n[image-2]:\t/images/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-28-at-11.34.50-pm.png","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2014-10-31-Mirosoft-Surface-and-my-thoughts-on-tablet-laptop-convergence/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 31, 2014","title":"Mirosoft Surface and my thoughts on tablet-laptop convergence","description":null}},{"excerpt":"This is a video of Steve Jobs in 1997 doing an informal Q&A with Apple developers at WWDC.

This was clearly a dig at Google.\n\nWhilst Apple is hoping to run every purchase you make through their Apple Pay payment system, they are \nnot going to collect that data.\n\nIn this age of ad-supported business models, it's surprising to hear a technology business stating they \ndon't want your data.\n\nWhen I heard that part, I could picture execs at Amazon and Google crying inside at the lost opportunity of getting some sweet sweet data. Much in the same way I can picture Apple and Microsoft execs cyring inside when Google gives away Android, Chrome OS, GMail, Google Docs, etc, etc away for \"free\".\n\nApple pushed out this messsage [over and over again][2]. All the Apple PR culminated with [this open letter][3] and their new \n[privacy policy][4]. The open letter is very reminiscent of Steve Jobs' Thoughts on [Flash][5][^2] and [Music][7][^3] open letters. This means it's a statement of intention. It's an important message about the future, strategtic direction of Apple's business.\n\nI don't think this is about Apple being concerned about your privacy (maybe they are, maybe they're not). This is about Apple doubling down on its business model of selling you shiny devices.\n\nI think this is interesting because it's Apple making a bet \nagainst big data. A bet that ad-supported, free products and services are ultimately going to be rejected by customers.\n\nFor a few years now, people have questioned if Apple's traditional business model (of selling you stuff at a nice mark-up) could survive in the new world of Google, Facebook and Amazon with their heavily subsidised and free products.\n\nI suppose this is Apple responding.\n\n## Big data, advertising and ad-supported products/services.\n\nBusinesses like Google and Facebook have huge investments in big data. For example, Facebook's data storage 6 months ago totalled 300 petabytes (15 zeroes) and ingesting data at a rate of 600 terabytes per day[^4]. At this scale, they are literally pushing the boundaries of computer science. You can bet that's expensive both in terms of their people's skill in writing software and the hardware/data centres they have to buy/build.\n\nThese companies believe that contained within these gigantic data sets, there is special (magical) information that can only be learned by collecting data sets of that size. This is at the heart of their business model of selling targeted ads.\n\nThis busines model was long ago coined by the nerds of the internetz as \"you are the product\". Interestingly, Tim Cook has used this well known phrase in [his letter][10] (emphasis mine):\n\n\n> A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, **you’re not the customer. You’re the product**.\n\nThis is true. When you use Google, you are not the customer. Google Search is not the product. A customer is the person paying the business to produce a product or service. You (your data) is sold to advertisers who are the ones that pay Google (and Facebook and Twitter and etc etc). By definition you are the product.\n\nBig data is an advertiser's wet dream. By collecting huge data sets on you through social media and Google searches, it is possible to not only know what demographic you are part of, but what you are thinking, feeling and even where you will be at a future date with fairly high degrees of accuracy. Research like \n[this][11] is commonplace. Researchers recently pushed the boundaries further by [finding out][12] if your emotional state (mood) can spread to your friends via Facebook posts. This can lead to not only influencing you (just like they do with traditional forms of advertising) but influencing you \nand your friends…at the same time.\n\nUnderstanding and collecting big data is so important to these businesses, that they are even willing to sacrifice user experience for the sake of it (as Facebook did by allowing experiements on almost 700,000 of their users without their knowledge[^5].\n\n\n## Apple's bet against big data.\n\n<p>\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"/images/2014/09/apple-pay.jpg\" />\n\t<figcaption> Banksy could not have done this better. Image source: TechCrunch (http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/09/announces-mobile-payments-solution-called-apple-pay/) </figcaption>\n</figure>\n</p>\n\nBig data is not just useful for the typical free-to-use-but-pay-with-your-data service/product. It's useful, to various degrees, to a range of businesses. It can tell the coffee shop that on Fridays people go to work later and hence the rush hour crowd should be prepared for a little later. It can tell your supermarket to stock more chips and beer on a Friday night. It can tell Apple that 30% of iPhone buyers will also buy an Apple branded case if given the choice and hence they should make and sell them at a 38% profit margin[^6].\n\nThis is why Apple's recent move to consciously know \nless about you - to not collect data - is so interesting. They are saying that they don't believe big data's payoff (it's insights into you as a consumer and all the magical, mind-control future possibilities) is ever going to crystallise and even if it does, it's not going to be worth the investment[^7].\n\n[Tim Cook is very explicit about Apple's business model][14]:\n\n> Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t “monetize” the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple.\n\nI have been thinking about this and I came up with 3 reasons for why Apple might be doing this:\n\n\n1. Apple has never really paid much attention to what users want. They like to tell you what you want and take away everything they don't think you need. This is at the core of Apple's product design philosophy[^8].Therefore, having insight into who you are and what you like is not really all that important to Apple.\n\n2. This offers Apple a huge point of differentiation from Google (whom Tim Cook pointed to as their main competitor)[^9]. Under Google's current ad-supported business model, they simply can't take this approach or they will go broke.This makes it a risky move for Apple because it may turn out that people don't really care about their privacy when in return they get a great product or service for free or heavily subsidised.\n\n3. Big data insights aren't all that accurate (and possibly never will be). When I watch YouTube I see a lot of ads for Toyota.Yet when I was buying my car:\n\t- I researched Ford car models using Google Search.\n\t- I emailed Ford dealers for quotes via GMail.\n\t- I stored brochures for Ford cars on Google Drive.\n\nYes Toyota, your money was well spent on Google. They targeted your product perfectly!\n\nThe thing with big data, and the entire digital media industry that surrounds it, is nobody knows if it works. There are lots of examples of it working. And there are examples like mine above that show that it doesn't work all that well (or maybe it does and my next car will be a Toyota). The beauty of it is, if it's not working, that's because they need more data; and if it works, that's because they told you it would work. The typical rainmaker argument - you can't lose until people stop believeing.\n\n## Understanding business models is key.\n\nFrom reading all this, you may think I have a bug up my arse about privacy and big data.\n\nNot at all.\n\nI see these topics from the point of view of scientific curiosity[^10].\n\nI find this all very interesting when looking at it from the point of view of the business model that drives these decisions. When you cut through all the spin, you start to have a glimpse at what this is all about.\n\n[Benedict Evans says it best here (@BenedictEvans) 25/09/2014 7:55 am][16]:\n\n> Apple does not collect data in much the same that Google does not charge. They're both giving someone else's business away for free.\n\nThis tweet sums it all up nicely. Understanding the business model helps you understand why these businesses are doing what they do.\n\nIt explains why Android phones and Chrome laptops are cheaper (no licencing fees for the OS in exchange for user data); why Facebook will pay $19 Bn for Whatsapp (more users == more data); and why Apple bought Beats and hired top people from Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry (they need people who know how to make and can influence you to buy shiny things).\n\nIt's still not clear to me at this stage if either business model is better than the other. They both work well. Both business models incentivise the business to make better products and make the user experience better. Google Search is a terrific product. So is a MacBook Pro. It's just very interesting that Apple, the biggest player in the tech industry, has just said no to one of these business models.\n\nI intend to write more posts like this sharing some of the things I've learned about the tech industry.\n\n[^1]:\tEddy Cue at 50min, Apple Event September 2014. \n\n[^2]:\t[Archived link][6] in case it goes down .\n\n[^3]:\tThe original version of this has been taken down.

People are, however, biased towards particular behaviour due to their life experiences.\n\nI think life presents you with certain choices that include compromises and people (Google) make the best choice they can with what they know at the time.\n\n[Google announced][1] on 13 January that it would acquire Nest for $3.2bn.\n\nI think this is a significant indicator of Google's strategy.\n\nI need to state two broad stroke premises:\n\n1. Google is an advertising business which uses it's core competency of large scale machine learning technology to target ads at a level of accuracy not previously possible before the internet revolution.\n\n2. [Nest][2] is (was?) a business focused on bringing traditionally \"dumb\" home products into modern times by making them \"smart\"[^1]. Their core competency is an experienced team making great products (led by Tony Fadell the \"godfather\" of the iPod) and proven with the Nest Thermostat.\n\nThere are some theories regarding why Google acquired Nest given Google's business does not require it to produce physical products end to end (in the same way e.g. Apple does).\n\n- Google's giant machine learning technology wants data from your home (via Nest) to get even better at predicting what you want and delivering that information to advertisers.\n\n- [Google is trying to become good][3] at being a products company to diversify it's current advertising business given its growth is highly correlated with the growth of internet usage which is predicted to peak in the next few years.\n\nI think there are many good points raised in the diversification argument, however, I see it as a side benefit. I find the acquisition to be quite in line with Google's current business model.\n\nJust because internet usage is set to peak, doesn't mean Google will peak with it. Google will still have its core competency - a giant pool of human behaviour data and probably the best engineering team in existence to decipher that data and produce products and information based on that data. I think it's narrow minded to think this core competency won't be valuable beyond an advertising business.\n\nI personally don't think Google is evil - selling your personal data to advertisers. I think that is currently a necessary compromise to achieve a greater goal. I think Google's aim is to build great products off the back of its core competency - it's just that this core competency takes a long time to develop and nobody on earth has the money and risk appetite to fund such a project.\n\nThink of it as you will, Google is currently an ad supported giant R&D project.\n\nAdvertising and sponsorship are currently the only ways to bring products to market without customers/users handing over cash. Most of the time, it's the best choice to keep bringing great products into the world.\n\nThis doesn't mean Google's business will always be advertising. If anything, this acquisition of Nest should be viewed positively that Google is maturing into a products company no longer reliant on ad money.\n\nThat would be an exciting thing.\n\n[^1]:\tSmart i.e.connected; creating an enjoyable interaction process with the user by learning to predict the user's behaviour where possible and providing an enjoyable UI where not. \n\n[1]:\thttps://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html\n[2]:\thttps://nest.com/about/\n[3]:\thttp://stratechery.com/2014/googles-new-business-model/","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2014-01-19-Googles-acquisition-of-Nest---who-is-Google/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 19, 2014","title":"Google's acquisition of Nest - who is Google","description":null}},{"excerpt":"We heard last year all about Everpix having to shutdown.

The iPad 2 was my first re-entry into the mobile computing world beyond a smartphone.\n\nFor a long time, I tried to adapt the work I needed to do on a mobile computer to the iPad platform. I went through the iPad 2 and then onto the iPad 3. I took them to Taiwan and Europe and used the camera connector kit to backup and view my photos from my SLR. I took them to class to take notes in lectures. I took them to work to take notes and keep organised.\n\nWhat I learned was that the full size iPads (9.7 inch models), were not made for people like me. It doesn't hurt to have one - it never does - but if I could have only taken one of either a OS X device or an iOS device for my non smartphone needs, for me, it would have been a difficult choice.\n\nUntil now.\n\nComputing on a MacBook is now insanely great.\n\nThe new line of Retina MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs released in 2013 with the Haswell 4th generation processors makes choosing between a MacBook vs an iPad a much fairer choice.\n\nThe iPads no longer have the trump cards of size/weight and battery life. Haswell has made that a much more even playing field. Add on the power saving improvements in OS X 10.9 Mavericks…and the battery life on these MacBooks is now truly \"all day\". 10 hours on the 13-inch Retina Pro and 13+ hours on the 13-inch Air.\n\nTo be fair, the iPads have caught up on their shortcomings too. The iPad Air and Retina Mini are now fairly beast-y when it comes down to computing power.\n\nThe comparison can now pretty much be solely made on the preferred operating system as the gap between everything else has been finally closed to a point where they are small trade-offs rather than deal breakers.\n\n[1]:\t/2013/06/20/Personal-statement-technology/","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2013-11-03-13-inch-MacBook-Pro-with-Retina-display-late-2013-model-and-iPad/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 03, 2013","title":"13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (late 2013 model) and iPad","description":null}},{"excerpt":"Mobile computing is starting to become crazy fast. ![20131030-232130.jpg][image-1]\n\nSource: [DF][1]\n\nTo provide some more items for comparison…","body":"\nMobile computing is starting to become crazy fast.\n\n![20131030-232130.jpg][image-1]\n\nSource: [DF][1]\n\nTo provide some more items for comparison (Source: [Geekbench 3][2]):\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n  <tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <th>\n\n    </th>\n    <th>\n      <strong>Single core</strong>\n    </th>\n    <th>\n      <strong>Multi core</strong>\n    </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>\n      <p>Mac Pro (Mid 2010)</p>\n      <p>Intel Xeon X5670 2930 MHz (12 cores)</p>\n    </th>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">2,518</p>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">27,195</p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>\n      <p>Samsung Galaxy Note 3</p>\n      <p>Exynos 5 Octa 5420 1900 MHz (4 cores)</p>\n    </th>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">960</p>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">2,819</p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>\n      <p>Asus Nexus 7 (2013)</p>\n      <p>Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064 1500 MHz (4 cores)</p>\n    </th>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">595</p>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">1,832</p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>\n      <p>Samsung Galaxy S II</p>\n      <p>Samsung Exynos 4210 1200 MHz (2 cores)</p>\n    </th>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">346</p>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <p align=\"right\">618</p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n[1]  http://daringfireball.net/2013/10/the_ipad_air\n[2]  http://browser.primatelabs.com\n\n[image-1]  /images/2013/10/20131030-232130.jpg\n","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2013-10-30-Mobile-computing/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 30, 2013","title":"Mobile computing","description":null}},{"excerpt":"“We believe that technology is at its very best, at its most empowering, when it simply disappears.”","body":"\n> \"We believe that technology is at its very best, at its most empowering, when it simply disappears.\"\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJkmc8-eyvE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n ","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2013-10-03-Technology/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 03, 2013","title":"Technology","description":null}},{"excerpt":"","body":"","fields":{"source":"photos","slug":"/nyc-aug-2013/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 01, 2013","title":"NYC August 2013","description":"NYC"}},{"excerpt":"This post is an open draft.

It will be updated...soon...**\n\nI had this sudden desire to see what pictures I had of my old desk setups after many months of [this][1] guilty pleasure.\n\nSurprisingly, I was able to dig up many old photos of my desk - enough to get a sense of how things have evolved over time. The notion of what a computer is has truly changed.\n\nThat moment of surprise has re-affirmed my belief in the importance of documentary photography. It's simply nice sometimes, and necessary at other times, to see how things were and how things have changed. I'm glad I took the time to carefully shoot, catalog and religiously backup all my images.\n\nIt brings back strong memories that otherwise might have been lost.\n\nSomehow, those memories turned into this blog post.\n\n## The days of the Windows boxes\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2002-10-16-at-19-32-14-winstons-room2.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>My first personal computer that was all mine: a Pentium II running Windows 95 then, badly, ran Windows 98. </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nI have always loved computers. As uncool as this was in the 90s, I always thought they were the coolest thing.\n\nThis was my first personal computer - a typical beige, Windows box I got when I started secondary school. Before this, I used the family's 386 running some form of DOS and then a 486 running Windows 3.1.\n\nI wish I had photos of those machines.\n\nComputers at that time were just for playing [Doom][2] and [Raiden][3] (for me) and doing boring spreadsheets, word processing and other productivity tasks (for \"grown-ups\").\n\nThen came dial-up modems and the internet kicked off - along with it, [Warcraft][4] and [Starcraft][5] multiplayer. I remember spending a lot of time playing [Worms][6] and [Heroes of Might and Magic][7] on this machine.\n\nThinking back, this machine was one of the worst experiences I had on a computer, especially when it was running Windows 98.  I spent most of my time looking at [blue screens][8] and the Windows boot screen. However, I didn't know any better, and I assumed that's how computers were supposed to behave.\n\nTo this day, I have not forgiven Microsoft for making me believe that to be true.\n\nLooking back to this time (mid to late 90s when I was about 12), my biggest regret is not learning to program on this machine. I thought I was a computer genius: figuring out for myself the system's file structure; DOS commands; making games run without the official CD; converting image files using MS Paint. Stuff that seems trivial now, but this was a time before Google and being \"on-line\" was a very deliberate and expensive exercise. I never knew back then there was a much deeper rabbit hole to go down. I am learning now, so better late than never.\n\n## Portable computing :: the stumble towards mobile computing\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2002-10-18-at-20-11-06-dsc00469.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Dell Inspiron, Pentium III, Windows XP.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nNext came the era of the portable computer. I had this laptop for a long time and it got me through most of secondary school and early university.\n\nIronically, this computer rarely left the house. Back then, there was never a reason to take a computer with you given the 1-2 hours of battery life.\n\nThis computer taught me a lot about hardware. I think mainly because this was around the early 2000s and hardware advancement was rocketing forward, which meant computer software, mainly graphics, was rocketing forward as well. The result of this rapid advancement was that I had a lot of programs that I couldn't run smoothly ([GTA 3][9] comes to mind, which, ironically, can now be played on a computer device that fits in my pocket).\n\nThrough the process of learning about hardware, I learned how much compromise was baked into consumer laptops of that time. The external computer speaker on the right kind of symbolises the shortcomings of laptops of this era - that every part of it was only just good enough to get the job done.\n\nThis was during a time when the industry was trying to move to the laptop as being the ultimate all-in-one and the only computer the average person would need. They just couldn't get it right. The laptop market evolved desperately to try to be that machine, but it was always too big and heavy or too small or too expensive. Eventually, it was the iPad that truly fit into that role as the computer for the average person - the computer for the proverbial mum.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2003-01-31-at-15-57-25-dsc00885.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Nokia 8850</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nI thought my [Nokia 8850][10] was the most beautiful phone on the planet. It never occurred to me at that time how well Nokia was making their phones and that computer makers should have applied that same whole product approach. Only Apple was doing that, and they were wildly unsuccessful compared to Dell who were turning computers into cheap commodities and were very successful.\n\nI guess I never thought about it because the computer part of the phone fell away and it was just all about the experience of using the phone.\n\nAn outcome that I now know as the goal of good design.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2005-07-06-at-14-26-15-dsc02546.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Wi-fi card expansion.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nEven after all those years putting up with the shitty trackpad, build quality and battery life of the Dell and the pile of buggy shit that was Windows, I can still appreciate the PC/Windows industry's love for tinkerers and always providing the ability to easily expand and replace hardware components at will - even on a laptop. What I didn't know at the time, however, was that with this flexibility, you end up with an inherently unstable operating system (given it must be built to accept a vast variety of hardware). Knowing that now, I have a much better appreciation and respect for what Microsoft did with Windows back then...but it doesn't change the fact Windows was shit.\n\n## Design :: computers as products\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2006-05-01-at-11-39-25-dsc00555.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>iPod (3rd Gen) and Palm Tungsten T</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nAs I progressed through university and started working part-time, I was able to acquire a few more gadgets, which, thankfully, allowed me to explore the world outside of Windows based computers. These new gadgets had different human-machine interfaces, both hardware and software, which were simply *better* than anything I had experienced before.\n\nI absolutely *love* how these two products changed my perception of how computers should work. I stopped looking at computers as computers and started to look at them as tools designed to solve problems.\n\nLooking back, these products were what sparked the beginning of my passion for whole product design. Meaning, it's not just the way the software works or how the hardware works. The important thing is how the \nproduct **works** to help you solve your problem.\n\nBefore that time, I always looked at hardware and software separately, which is how the [Wintel][11] PC industry looked at it (and the main reason for why they were shitty experiences).  I feel, back then, only a few players, like Nokia, Apple and Palm, really understood the importance of design when it came to computer products.\n\nThey understood that design was about *so* much more than just the way something *looks* but the way something actually *works*. They understood it was about the *user experience*. A term so widely embraced now it's simply known as UX.\n\nThe progression of the Mac and iPhone took that spark and propelled design to be one of my main interests today. These products proved that good design was the only thing lacking in computers - stopping them from becoming mainstream wonders that everyone can appreciate.\n\nGreat design revealed a computer's magic to everyone that for a very long time only nerds (and Macintosh diehards) could see.\n\nI am just happy that product design is a core part of the computer industry today.\n\n## Designed in California :: a glass of ice water after being in hell\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2005-09-10-at-16-50-19-dsc02765.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>iMac G5</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nI saw an old interview with Steve Jobs where they asked him whether the iPod's [halo effect][12] was why people were switching to Macs. He replied that it was a big reason, but another reason was how bad Windows Vista was.\n\nFor me, the reason was both.\n\nThe only Apple product I had owned up to that point (the iPod) worked really really well. On the other hand, I had owned many Wintel PCs which worked really really bad - I just didn't know it yet.\n\nAt this point in time in 2005, the Wintel PC market  was probably in the worst state it had ever been in. This was a time when Dell was the epitome of a PC: shitting out cheap, crappy boxes that broke *a lot*, and infested every home and every office. Microsoft was still on XP and was about to roll out Windows Vista which was [widely regarded][13] as a terrible OS - so terrible, most people skipped it.\n\nApple, with Mac OS X and the [digital hub strategy][14], on the other hand, were doing everything right. Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger had just been released which looked space age compared to anything else out there (to this day, I cannot multi-task on Windows as well as I can on OS X). They were focusing on making the OS more compatible with Windows which was traditionally the main reason not to use Apple products. Most importantly, the iMac was good value. Outside of building your own PC, given like for like components, a Dell PC box wasn't *that* much cheaper.\n\nThe traditional reasons to not switch to a Mac were fading away and the seeds planted by Steve Jobs after his return to Apple in 1997 were finally in full bloom. And who could forget [these ads][15].\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2006-11-19-at-02-20-59-dsc00705.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>iMac G5</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nMy experience with my first Mac wasn't all roses though, especially not at first.\n\nWhenever people ask me if they should switch to Mac, I always warn them that it takes a while to get used to it. It took me about 3 months...3 months of swearing at the computer and asking it why it had to be like that. I guess it took some time to rehabilitate from a decade of being warped by Windows usage.\n\nHowever, after learning *why* the Mac does things differently, I've come to really appreciate the thought gone into those decisions. All the problems that the designers had to overcome to give the user the best possible solution and experience.\n\nEven for little things.\n\nLike the ability to scroll through content inside non-active windows by mousing over them and scrolling. The way the save dialog box is attached to the application it relates to and doesn't stop you from doing anything else. The way the [indicator light][16] disappears completely when off.\n\nThese details, showed a level of care and obsession by the creators of the Mac that resonated with me deeply. Their commitment to simplicity, clarity, efficiency and bringing order to complexity.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GzqXc3v4JZg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIt wasn't all good though. Apple does some things really badly. Like the one-button mouse. In fact, they've never made a good mouse. Great ideas throughout the years but never created anything that really hit the mark. This doesn't just go for the mouse hardware, the default OS X [mouse acceleration curve][17] is absolutely terrible.\n\nUltimately, I think that's why they gave up on it and put all their efforts into the multi-touch trackpad...which is perfect. This dedication to product design is why I use a Mac.\n\nI have never looked back.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2007-12-02-at-04-01-21-dsc00798.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>1st Gen Mid-2007 MacBook Pro (one of the worst laptop keyboards ever made)</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2009-06-17-at-04-40-49-img_0401.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Mid-2008 Intel Core 2 Duo iMac</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/20110513_201902_20110513-201902-_rli1509.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Mid-2011 iMac - current main computer</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\n## The post-PC era :: the computer, finally a human tool, a bicycle for our minds\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/2010-05-14-at-00-26-49-img_0601.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>iPhone 3GS</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nI could go on and on about [post-PC devices][18], but I'll just say this - the iPhone along with the iPad, really embodies my belief in what computers are all about - their purpose. Steve Jobs said it best with this anecdote:\n\n> I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific America had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.\n\nAnd that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.\n\nThroughout human history, progression has been made through creating and using tools. Our species [progressed][19] on the back of the creation of tools and passing down this knowledge from generation to generation throughout the ages.\n\nFor the computer, this tool, to be useful, it has to be easy to use.\n\nNot just for nerds like me, but for everyone. People are tool makers and these tools help us do amazing things. The computer is probably the most powerful tool we've ever had. That's why it's so important that everyone has access to it and the ability to use it.\n\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/20130607_073629_20130607_073629__rli8428.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Computers are now truly just tools</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nI think the picture above says a lot about where the computer industry is right now - a great place. We live in a world now of multiple devices which are all extremely powerful and easy to use.\n\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2013/06/img_1750.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>A picture taken of my current toolset by another computer (iPhone 5) that fits in my pocket and is more powerful than the machine that NASA used to put the first person on the moon (and bring him safely back). Amazing.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nThere is a lot of choice in the market and companies are focusing on product design. Even Microsoft (where it all began for me) has started making complete, whole products (end-to-end: software, hardware and user experience) like the [Surface][20] and the [X-Box][21]. Even Windows 7 is very good now (for what it is).\n\n## What's next...\n\n![macpro-cutaways-660x232][image-1]\n\nIf I had one comment on where things are headed, it would be that the computer industry, and Apple in particular, may be too focused on the consumer market - making products that are great to use for the average user, but not including features that power users want.\n\nThe 2013 Mac Pro, I feel, is an example of this. Apple's computer hardware is becoming too locked down. You used to be able to swap out most components that become obsolete very easily (hard drive, RAM, etc) but these are becoming proprietary and sealed inside. Even the Mac Pro is becoming more like this.\n\nI don't think hardware expandability should be achieved by using a modular approach for now. The parts and cables are too expensive and simply not advanced enough yet compared to their cheaper and faster internal (PCIe) counterparts.\n\nThis approach is limiting the choice available to power users. Power users are the ones who eventually go on to create the next generation of tools. Their choice shouldn't be limited.\n\nHowever, I'm not worried about it. Things change in the computer industry - I probably would have felt the same way about the floppy disk disappearing.\n\nI'm simply excited about what's next.\n\n[1]:\thttp://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1496069&page=71\n[2]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)\n[3]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiden_(video_game)\n[4]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans\n[5]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starcraft\n[6]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)\n[7]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_might_and_magic\n[8]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death\n[9]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_theft_auto_3\n[10]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_8850/8890\n[11]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel\n[12]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect#Real_world_applications\n[13]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Windows_Vista\n[14]:\thttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9046oXrm7f8\n[15]:\thttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZSBWbnmGrE\n[16]:\thttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15eBDhhybco\n[17]:\thttp://osxdaily.com/2010/08/25/mouse-acceleration/\n[18]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-PC_era\n[19]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Human_Journey\n[20]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface\n[21]:\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2013/06/macpro-cutaways-660x232.jpg","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2013-06-20-Personal-statement-technology/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"June 20, 2013","title":"Personal statement :: technology","description":null}},{"excerpt":"I took this eBay listing as an opportunity to use my camera and lighting equipment.

[Here][1] if you're interested in buying.\n\nNothing fancy...just blasted a SB-900 speedlight into a wall at one end of a corridor and put the chair at the other end.  I just wanted to create some consistent soft light by shutting out the ambient.\n\nI think my settings were f8 at 1/200 of a second shutter speed and ISO200 with speedlight at full power.  Camera settings were used to kill any ambient with shutter speed used at as fast as what I feel comfortable using some cheap Chines made radio triggers so I didn't catch the shutter half way across (and even then I did with one frame - weird).  I think the sync speed for my D700 is 1/250 (from memory) so 1/200 I felt was decently safe.  I wouldn't mind a set of new pocket wizards, but money money money.\n\nPost processing was simple. Just did some white balance adjustments (for some reason the Adobe Camera Raw default pumped way too much red into the picture and the walls were turning my speedlight yellow - at least I hope it was the walls and not my speedlight being faulty).  Adjusted the tones a bit to boost up the contrast. Did some straightening/cropping to fix up some lazy camera composing.

Your camera may already be able to do what you want if you switch the mode away from that “P” on the dial. Or start shooting in RAW mode and learn to use some post-production software like Lightroom or Aperture so you can fix up the colour balance and recover some of those blown out highlights. Learning a little about these two things will make a huge difference compared to buying a “better” camera.\n\nIn this post, my aim is to gently push you in the general direction of finding the best camera for what you are planning to take pictures of. As a bonus, I will throw in some user tips to get you going. This blog will not contain detailed reviews of cameras. There are plenty of resources on the web already for that type of thing. I would recommend using [DP Review][1] to fulfil your pixel-peeping and measure-bating desires (seriously, that site has everything you’d ever want to know about individual cameras and lenses).\n\n### /Category rather than camera.\n\nGiven the sheer number of different cameras, I thought I would talk more to the camera category. Most of the cameras in a category are fairly similar and many differences come down to personal preference. I have, however, noted down some popular cameras in each category to get you started.\n\nThis list is in order from cheapest to most expensive:\n\n- **Smartphone ($):** (cheapest because it's an add-on to a product you most likely already own) e.g. [iPhone 5S][2], [Nokia Lumia 1020][3], [Samsung Galaxy S4][4], [HTC One][5].\n- **Compact camera ($):** e.g. any camera from Sony, Panasonic, Canon, Nikon under $200. Note: this category is pretty much obsolete due to the increasingly amazing quality of smartphone cameras. \n- **Advanced compact (meaning compacts with manual controls and ability to shoot in RAW mode) ($$):** e.g. [Canon Powershot S120][6], [Panasonic Lumix LX7][7]/[LF1][8], [Fujifilm FinePix X20][9].\n- **Electronic Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens (EVIL) aka \"Mirrorless” ($$$):** e.g. [Panasonic G-series][10], [Fujifilm X-Pro1][11], [Sony NEX-series][12], [Leica M9][13].\n- **DSLR:**\n\t- **Entry level ($$$):** e.g. any DSLR camera in the $1,000 range.\n\t- **Enthusiast level ($$$$):** e.g. [Canon 6D][14], [Nikon D7100][15], [Nikon D610][16], [Nikon Df][17].\n\t- **Professional level ($$$$$):** e.g. [Canon EOS 5D Mk III][18], [Canon EOS 1D X][19], [Nikon D800][20], [Nikon D4][21].\n\n### /Camera gear is about compromise.\n\nThere is a horrendous amount of choice when it comes to cameras, and even more choice when you start adding lenses into the mix.\n\nWhy? Photography is *all* about compromise. This is simply due to the physical limitations of optics and capturing light. Cameras must compromise between features to capture the type of light the photographer is chasing.\n\nSimply put, no camera system can do everything well unless you are prepared to carry a lot of weight and spend a lot of cash (compromises in themselves). That is simply the nature of the beast that is photography. I guarantee you every camera excels in some areas and absolutely sucks in others. Some excel in two or more areas and you \n pay for that benefit.\n\nPhotography includes so many different genres and cameras are used in so many different environments, camera manufacturers have to make a wide variety of cameras to suit them all. Then overlay the different schools of thought on what's important and what's not and the camera iterations become endless.\n\n## //Best camera for what you are shooting.\n\n### /Travel.\n\nYou can take a DSLR and a bag full of lenses while on a trip...if your purpose is solely to take photos. However, for most people, travel also includes eating, shopping, seeing shows, relaxing, etc.\n\nIdeally for traveling, you want something easy to carry and doesn’t scream mug me. Otherwise, you will break your back, your wallet, or both.\n\nI would recommend an advanced compact or if you have the money, an EVIL/mirrorless camera like the [Sony NEX-series][22]. Both these options give you a very powerful toolkit without the weight and bulk of a DSLR kit which means you can enjoy the place, rather than focus all your attention on the photography.\n\nIf you are more of an observer and are into street photography style travel photos, I’d also recommend looking at some specialty cameras like the [Fujifilm X100S][23] or, if you have money, the [Leica M9][24]. These cameras are not for the faint of heart, but if you go and have a look at them, they could be the travel camera you’re looking for.\n\n### /Parties and social gatherings.\n\nGenerally, in these situations, you’re in a fairly dark place. Therefore the most important features you will need are a camera with a \"bright\" lens (meaning a big aperture that lets in a tonne of light) and an image sensor that can hit crazy high ISOs. Image stabilisation helps too to eliminate camera shake at slow shutter speeds.\n\nWith these features, your camera has more freedom to shoot at a higher shutter speed (eliminating blur) and can still produce clean images in dark conditions (good high ISO performance).\n\nAlso, the camera should be small unless you want to photograph the event rather than enjoy it.\n\nFor these reasons, I would recommend an advanced compact (e.g. [Canon Powershot S120][25], [Panasonic Lumix LX7][26]/\n[LF1][27], [Fujifilm FinePix X20][28]).\n\nThis camera category includes cameras with quite good lenses which have large apertures that open up as far as f1.4 in some cases and also have great sensors that hit crazy ISOs of 12,800 (5 years ago, you would be looking at a $8,000 pro-level DSLR for ISO performance like that).\n\nThe added bonus is that some are about the size of a deck of playing cards (i.e. \n[Canon S120][29]).\n\nFor some novelty, you might also want to find a camera with a “slow shutter syncro” feature (different manufacturers will call it different things but it’s essentially a camera that can do \"rear-curtain sync\" as an option when using the flash - then just have to use a long-ish shutter speed for the exposure, say, 1/4 second). That way when you are forced to use flash because it’s so dark, you can create some cool light trail effect like this picture below by [Nick Onken][30].\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2012/12/Image3_onken_110320_NYCfun_082.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Photo credit: Nick Onken</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\n### /Kids and pets.\n\nThe issue here is that these subjects mover around a lot...and very quickly.\n\nTherefore, the most important factor in getting a good picture is using a high shutter speed to “freeze” the action. Otherwise, the subject will be blurry (unless that's the \"artistic\" effect you're going for).\n\nSimilar to shooting in dark places, the only way your camera can get the right exposure (picture isn’t too dark or bright) is to have lots of freedom to adjust the aperture and ISO. Therefore, similar with the above, I would again recommend an advanced compact or EVIL/mirrorless camera.\n\n\nTry keeping the shutter speed above 1/160th of a second which can be done by using shutter priority mode or selecting sports mode.\n\n### /Sports and nature.\n\nYou might find it funny that these two categories are grouped together, but they are actually very similar (which says a lot in itself). In both situations, you are witnessing an event from a fair distance away and the subjects are moving extremely fast.\n\nIf you look at the pros shooting any professional sporting event, the camera lenses are huge. You will also see this phenomenon with nature photographers too (especially bird photographers).\n\nFor sports and nature you need a camera with a lens that has a long focal length aka telephoto (i.e. zooms-in real good) and also ideally one that lets in a tonne of light (big aperture, f2.8 and larger). This combo allows you to shoot from very far away (assuming you don’t have an all-access pass) and use a fast shutter speed to “freeze” the action. If you're shooting in lower light conditions (late afternoon), you will have to shoot at very high ISOs to keep the shutter speed fast enough to eliminate motion blur (think 3200-6400 ISO when shooting at f2.8 to get the 1/1000 shutter speed you need to freeze the action).\n\nThe ability to shoot at a high framerate is also very handy so you can let that camera's motor-drive really rip to give you you the best chance of getting that perfect shot. It might not seem that important, but a camera that can shoot at 4fps (avg for a low end DSLR) compared to one that clicks away at 12fps (avg for a high-end DSLR dedicated to sports) is 3 times the amount of photos every second. This means when motor-drive shooting Roger Federer hitting a serve, at 4fps you might get the beginning, the mid swing, and the end of the service action. At 12fps, you will get all those moments in-between as well...and then some.\n\nI will mention, if you are shooting sports or nature, you are heading down a very deep rabbit hole. Normally, people will say gear doesn’t matter, it’s the photographer and their skill. I would say that’s true except for sports and nature. This is an area of photography where gear matters a great deal (of course you also need to know how use the gear). Therefore, I would recommend having a think about your budget and how serious you are.\n\nYou can be perfectly fine using a Canon S100, it zooms to 120mm which is nothing to laugh at, and its shutter speed goes quite high with a very wide ISO range to play with.\n\nHowever, nothing beats having something like a Nikon D4 or Canon 1D X with a 400mm f2.8 lens attached. You will be able to push that camera to the limits and get a picture, whilst sitting at the back of the stadium, of Usain Bolt’s sweat beads flying off of his face as he crosses the 100m finish line at midnight. However, that will also cost you about $15,000 and break your back as you carry all that gear from you car.\n\nSo realistically, if you’re only semi-serious about it, I would recommend something like a [Nikon D7100][31] and the best zoom lens you can afford covering that 70-200mm range and above. That will be an excellent kit to start off with, and you will learn along the way and know where to go from there.\n\n*User tip: Try to keep your shutter speed above 1/1000th of a second for that crisp action shot. You will be really pushing the limits of your gear (using high ISOs) so don’t be disheartened if the image doesn’t look like it came out of a magazine - for once, you can actually blame your gear.*\n\n### /Landscape.\n\nThe most important feature for landscape photography is dynamic range and large image sensors with giant pixel counts (Note: giant megapixel numbers alone won't cut it, it's really the large image sensor).\n\nThe human eye has a much wider dynamic range than even a high end camera. That’s why you can see the blue sky and the person sitting in the shade at the same time on a sunny day. When you take a photo of this scene, depending on your camera settings, the sky will either be blown out to white, or the person in the shade will be pitch black.\n\nMost cameras have a landscape mode which means the software inside the camera will attempt to even out the exposure by processing the image a certain way or it will take a few different pictures at various exposure settings and combine them into a single image (usually called HDR mode or high contrast mode).\n\nAnother handy feature is panorama stitching which will help you automatically stitch together sections of a scene into one big photo (if you don't want to do that in post-production on a computer).\n\nLandscape photography is a serious pursuit and that’s why it’s hard to recommend a camera. The quality you want from the photos, the amount of extra gear you’re willing to carry, and your willingness to learn to use post-production software on your computer will ultimately determine which camera to get.\n\nAn advanced compact is probably the best place to start given it’s so handy in every other situation and you can advance from there once you’ve decided you’re serious.\n\n*User tip: Play around with the scene and picture modes of your camera to really get the colours and details to pop. Try them all and see what you like, don’t just pick “landscape”.*\n\n# //General info about features, pricing.\n\nI've put together the following summary showing all the important features and which camera category caters specifically for this feature by compromising other aspects like price or battery life or compactness. I have also put in brackets what kind of price tag this feature normally commands.\n\n- **Value for many:** Advanced Compact\n- **Quick startup ($$):** DSLR\n- **Build quality ($$$):** High-End DSLR (there is a quote that goes something like: a pro-level DSLR can be used to beat someone to death and still be used to take a picture of the body)\n- **Ease of use ($):** Smartphone\n- **Compact and easily carried all day ($):** Smartphone, compact and advanced compact\n- **Interchangeable lenses ($$$):** DSLR, EVIL\n- **High frames per second ($$-$$$$$):** \"Mirrorless\" and very high-end DSLRs dedicated to sports e.g. Nikon D4 and Canon 1D X.\n- **Dynamic range and details ($$$):** DSLR with full frame sensor e.g. Nikon D800\n- **Professional grade video ($$$):** DSLR with full frame sensor\n- **Low light and high ISO performance ($$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$):** High-end DSLR\n\nIf a lot of these terms don't mean much to you, then they aren't going to mean much more once you drop $1-2,000 into a new camera system. *If* this is you, I would take a guess that you have a decent camera already and just need to learn how to make the most of it and learn its limitations before you upgrade. So read on...\n\n## //What’s wrong with my current camera?\n\nCameras are ultimately dumb devices. For a basic auto program, the camera looks at the scene in front of you and adjusts all the settings (aperture, shutter speed and ISO) to get you the “best” picture it can. Unfortunately, “best” to the camera means 18% grey.\n\nThis is 18% grey\n\n![18% grey][image-1]\n\nYup. Looks exactly like the Eiffel Tower at sunset doesn’t it?!\n\nThe reason why your camera’s auto mode won’t take good pictures essentially comes down to three things (explained below), and the most likely reason is the metering. You should NOT upgrade your camera if that is the reason for the bad photos. Take some time to learn about exposure and then go from there.\n\n### /Metering.\n\nThe auto modes have largely improved with time and these days cameras have very sophisticated sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) to calculate the best exposure (and understands not every scene should be 18% grey). Unfortunately, the camera makers don’t put the best AI in the cheap cameras - probably to perpetuate the myth that you need a better camera to take better pictures so they can keep up-selling you.\n\n### /Sensor quality.\n\nBetter sensors perform better when the ISO is turned up (so you can shoot in low light). They produce less noise or they produce noise patterns that are easy for software to eliminate. Either way, you get a cleaner picture and you get more options (wider useable ISO range). Better sensors are also bigger in physical size. The bigger sensors also tend to have higher quality pixels, which means more detail and better accuracy for rendering images. Bigger and better sensors are more expensive and require a larger camera to house them.\n\n### /Lens quality.\n\nGood lenses cost a *lot* of money. The lens contained in a little point and shoot is not as good as a $3,500 Canon L-series lens. Big lenses let in more light, which means big lenses are made of more glass. More glass means more money (especially given the quality of the glass). It also means more weight. See all the compromises piling up....\n\n## //Do I need a DSLR?\n\nIf you are asking this question, the most likely answer is: NO!\n\nWhy?\n\nAs camera technology has matured, the DSLR is starting to become an obsolete piece of technology due to rapid advances in \"mirrorless\" camera technology.\n\nThe traditional advantage of an SLR camera is that you can see the world through the lens. Seeing the world through the lens meant that you had a 1:1 reproduction of what the film was seeing. Very handy back when it used to take 1-2 weeks before you got your film back from the lab - then only to find out the exposure had been blown all over the place, but hey, you got your framing right thanks to your SLR!\n\nThis advantage has started to become obsolete due to the advances in digital camera technology whereby you can now see \"live\" exactly what the camera sensor is ready to record and then instantly preview the picture as soon as you take it. Therefore, one of the main advantages of the DSLR has become obsolete. Sure, this \"mirrorless\" technology is still maturing (the current iteration is sort of laggy and chews through batteries), but in a few years, these issues will go away as the technology gets better.\n\nSo when you compare an entry-level DSLR to a decent \"mirrorless\" camera, there aren't any real compelling reasons to choose the DSLR. It's only in the mid to high-end DSLRs where you will find features that make it more worth it to carry around such an expensive and heavy kit. If you need these high-end features, you will know exactly why you want a DSLR.\n\nThe take home message is: don't over-stretch yourself. Just because your compact sucks doens't mean you need a DSLR. There are a tonne of cameras in between. If your decision process lands you at an entry-level DSLR, your decision making process has probably gone wrong somewhere. The most likely scenario is that you buy an entry-level DSLR (because the others are too expensive) and once you get around to learning how to use it, and more generally about photography, you will find out the genre of photography you enjoy and want to pursue requires a bigger sensor, or higher fps, or 9 steps of exposure compensation for HDR ...and you need to upgrade.\n\nThere are very few reasons to get an entry-level DSLR given the quality of EVIL/mirrorless cameras coming out these days.\n\n## //Do I need a new camera?\n\nProbably not.\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this post, learning to use your current camera and some post-production techniques can take you miles. You'd be surprised. Learning about contrast and how the curves tool works alone will open up a whole new world of imaging to you.\n\nA smartphone with a good camera and a quality suite of apps will take you very far! You will be amazed at what can be achieved with such simple tools. I am a strong proponent of learning to photograph via the use of a good smartphone.\n\nTake a look at what [Jeremy Cowart][32] has been able to achieve with an iPhone and some apps.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2012/12/Image4_Cowart-copy.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>iPhone photos by Jeremy Cowart</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\n## //If you actually read all the way to the bottom of this post...\n\nYou should really be out there making more images rather than thinking about gear. At the end of the day, gear doesn't really matter…unless you're in a war zone (weddings count as war zones).\n\n[1]:\thttp://www.dpreview.com\n[2]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=apple%20iphone%205s&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[3]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=nokia%20lumia%201020&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[4]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BV1NKCW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00BV1NKCW&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[5]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMVLH66/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CMVLH66&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[6]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EFILNV8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EFILNV8&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[7]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MB719C/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008MB719C&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[8]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CFCTDMC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CFCTDMC&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[9]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AV3XH9W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AV3XH9W&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[10]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=lumix%20g%20digital%20single%20lens%20mirrorless&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[11]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AC7GMOO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AC7GMOO&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[12]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=sony%20nex&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[13]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NX13NA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002NX13NA&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[14]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009B0MZ8U/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B009B0MZ8U&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[15]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI9X7UC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BI9X7UC&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[16]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FOTF8M2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FOTF8M2&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[17]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GD1KBLI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00GD1KBLI&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[18]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FGYZFI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007FGYZFI&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[19]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Y3T1AI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005Y3T1AI&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[20]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076AYNXM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0076AYNXM&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[21]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U49XM6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B006U49XM6&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[22]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=aps&keywords=sony%20nex&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[23]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATM1MVA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[24]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NX13NA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002NX13NA&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[25]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EFILNV8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EFILNV8&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[26]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MB719C/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B008MB719C&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[27]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CFCTDMC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00CFCTDMC&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[28]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AV3XH9W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00AV3XH9W&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[29]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EFILNV8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00EFILNV8&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[30]:\thttp://nickonken.com\n[31]:\thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BI9X7UC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BI9X7UC&linkCode=as2&tag=robertwlicom-20\n[32]:\thttp://jeremycowart.com/portfolio/iphone/\n[33]:\t/images/2

Steve was among the greatest of American innovators - brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it.\n> \n> By building one of the planet’s most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity. By making computers personal and putting the internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible, but intuitive and fun. And by turning his talents to storytelling, he has brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike. Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world.\n> \n> The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him.\n\nSteve Jobs' commencement address at Stanford in 2005 is one of those most inspirational speeches I've ever heard. I remember copying the transcript and highlighting the parts that resonated with me the most. Below is what it read:\n\n> I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.\n> \n> The first story is about connecting the dots.\n> \n> I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?\n> \n> It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.\n> \n> And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.\n> \n> It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:\n> \n> Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.\n> \n> None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.\n> \n> **Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.**\n> \n> My second story is about love and loss.\n> \n> I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.\n> \n> I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.\n> \n> I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\n> \n> During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.\n> \n> I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. **I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.**\n> \n> My third story is about death.\n> \n> When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:  **\"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.\"** It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.\n> \n> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\n> \n> About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.\n> \n> I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now.\n> \n> This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:\n> \n> No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.\n> \n> \n> **Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.**\n> \n> When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\n> \n> Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\" It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.\n> \n> Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\n> \n> Thank you all very much.\n\nThank you Steve.","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2011-10-06-Steve-Jobs-1955-2011/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 06, 2011","title":"Steve Jobs 1955-2011","description":null}},{"excerpt":"I wrote a post a while back stating how useful a tool the camera phone is in studying composition.  The iPhone 4 with its apps makes it…","body":"\nI wrote a [post][1] a while back stating how useful a tool the camera phone is in studying composition.  The iPhone 4 with its apps makes it great for post processing the photos as well.  It truly is a great \"camera\".\n\nAlso around this time I decided that to learn to take better photos, I needed to take more photos.  Lots of photos.  But with a purpose.  And I had to use a camera that was with me all the time.  So born was the Instagram project.\n\nBetween June and August 2011, my aim was to get my Instagram photo count up to 100 by capturing and processing an image with my iPhone 4 on average one per day.  Below are 20 of my favorites with a some of my thoughts.\n\nAll of these photos were captured and processed with my iPhone 4.  I captured the images with [Camera+][2] and used a combination of [Camera+][3], [Filterstorm][4] and [Snapseed][5] for prost processing.  Every day I would train my eye to be on the lookout for interesting compositional elements around me and take a picture of it: on the way to and from work, out shopping, eating, waiting....everywhere.\n\nThe limitations of the iPhone camera are its strengths: long start-up time, slow shutter response, it is noisy, it doesn't have optical zoom, its lens distorts things badly, it over-processes colours.  Because of all these things it does badly, every picture taken with it can focus on the basics of photography that don't rely on any of these bells and whistles: composition.  No need to worry about freezing motion, or capturing the colours of a sunset, or turning that waterfall silky smooth...just worry about the design elements and composition: rule of thirds, leading lines, balance, repeating shapes and form, contrast, colour, negative space etc etc.\n\nBy no means are these amazing images - they are more like interesting sentences that don't fit together into a paragraph.  In each of them, I tried to pick out a design / compositional element from what I saw in my environment and incorporate that element into an image.  The goal was to become better and quicker at picking out these elements.\n\nI think with cameras as amazing as they are nowadays, a clean, well exposed image is not enough.  The true differentiation now between a good image and a mediocre one is the moment it captures and the design elements used to present and enhance that moment.  This is the key reason these images are not great, because there is no real intentional connection between the moment and the design elements - for most of them, there are no moments captured at all only compositional elements.\n\nI did learn a lot from this exercise and would recommend it to anyone interested in improving their photography.  A 5 megapixel camera goes a long way.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6083/6081277072_c07eed7a80_z.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Leading lines.  Depth.  Rule of thirds.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6192/6074818864_c7806a7b1a_z.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>The contrast in textures.

Pick a bunch of photos (500 is probably minimum), arrange them in some kind of logical order following a rough story (in order of time is probably easiest).\n2. Export them into a video file format that plays the photos back at a high frame rate.\n3. Edit the video file by varying the speed of certain parts, adding music, adding text, intro, outro etc etc\n\nThat's the general gist of how it was done, more details below.\n\n## Method in detail\n\nAll up, this project probably took me about 16 hours over the course of a week.  8 of those hours were devoted to sorting through and editing the photos.\n\n### Step 1 - sorting and editing the photos:\n\n**Manage and sort your photos**\n\nI currently use Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 as my digital asset manager (DAM) for all my photos.  I'm pretty sure any DAM software can do this.  On this occasion, all of my New Zealand Trip 2009 photos were still in my Apple Aperture legacy library and I was able to replicate what I normally do out of Lightroom inside Aperture.\n\nI took about 600-700 images from my library which was essentially a dump of all of my photos and friends photos/videos from the trip.  I had not really bothered to go through these photos at the time other than to select about 20 or so to share around which is the main reason why I decided to make this video - most people would be bored to tears looking at 600+ photos, so why not cut the viewing time down without losing the essence of the trip and hopefully make it fun in the process.\n\n**Crop your photos**\n\nThe first thing to do is to crop all the photos to a 16:9 ratio which is what HD 720p/1080p HD video is played back at (my terminology when it comes to video is complete noob so bare with me).  This is the most important step.  If this isn't done, most video software will warp and stretch your images to fit it inside the aspect ratio of the video file.  A lot of portrait orientation shots will have to be heavily cropped and at times it will be hard to choose what should fill the frame.  I found this mass cropping process quickest by cropping one photo in landscape orientation and auto apply this same crop to all my other photos also in landscape orientation.  Then I repeated this for portrait orientated photos and finally, painstakingly went through each photo making sure the crop was right for each photo (e.g. making sure the horizon line for a sequence was about the same level in the photo).  Any good DAM software like Lightroom or Aperture can do this mass cropping exercise quickly.\n\n**Sequence your photos and start seeing them as video frames**\n\nNext, I spent a lot of time arranging the photos into related sets with the intention to turn them into video (i.e. position the photos into sequences).  The important thing here is to arrange pictures that have the same kind of background and subject content together and into some kind of logical order.  The logic depends on the story you want to tell.  What I noticed worked well was to place the photos in some kind of moving sequence.  So if you have multiple photos of the same subject moving across the frame, or getting bigger within the frame, it worked really well when played back in motion.  If I were to shoot photos in the future for the purpose of making a video like this, I would deliberately shoot frames in sequences (e.g. walking down a street, moving around an object etc).\n\n**Post-process your photos and give them a similar look**\n\nThe next step is to do some light post-processing on every photo.  This task will either be easy or hard depending on how well the photos were taken in the first place (for me it was quite difficult given the photos were from four different cameras, taken by very different people using very different metering modes).  The main objective here is to make the photos look roughly similar in terms of exposure and colour.  This process would be a lot harder if for example you used auto white balance and each photo was a different shade of yellow / blue depending on how well the camera metered for white balance.  Same goes for the exposure.  The aim is to lift and/or drop each photo to a harmonious white balance and exposure level so there is not any noticeable difference between them.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you can add some more toning and colour adjustments to each sequence of photos to change the mood of each photo, however, the key is to be consistent otherwise there will be weird flickers in the video (probably notice them in my video hehe).  The adjustment sync features in your DAM software will be your friend here.\n\n### Step 2 - making the initial video file for the photos:\n\n**QuickTime 7 is your friend**\n\nThe next step is probably easiest.  I used QuickTime Player 7 Pro and its \"open image sequence\" feature (there are like 1,000 different versions of this app, so here's the [link][2]).  What it basically does is put all your images into a sequence at a frame rate you specify - slow (e.g. 1 frame every 30 seconds) or fast (e.g. 120 frames per second).  Each picture is a video frame, and you decide how many flick by in a second.\n\n**Export the photos into a standardises naming and file convention**\n\nTo do this, you export your images (in the order you want them to appear in the video) from your DAM software and have them exported with a custom filename in a \"name x of y.jpg\" format.  That way, they will sit inside the export folder on your hard drive in the desired order you arranged them in.\n\n**Convert the image sequence into a video file**\n\nThen it's just a matter of opening up the first jpeg file in QuickTime and it does the rest of the magic.  You should experiment with the frame rate to see what feels best.  I chose 12 fps which is really fast, but I figured it would be easier slowing down important parts in my video editor than to speed large parts of it up.  Another thing to note here is that depending on how many photos you end up using and the frame rate you play them back at will determine the approximate length of your video.\n\n**Export the video file into a format your video editor can work with**\n\nI exported this file from QuickTime in H.264 format at 1080p (this way I had the choice of exporting it as something smaller out of the video editor for sharing on the web).  I don't know that much about video so it may be better to export at ProRes or whatever your video editor likes to work in.\n\n### Step 3 - video editing:\n\n**Using a video editor to give the video some visual interest and music to create mood**\n\nNow that the majority of the content is done, the other 8 hours is spent here.  I used Final Cut Pro X as my video editor as it was probably designed for photographers doing video.  It's very simple to use (and probably why people nicknamed it iMovie Pro) but still has some really nice advanced controls.  I think in all honesty iMovie or equivalent would have sufficed.  A lot of the work here and how good the final presentation will be really depends on your video editing knowledge for which I am only a beginner in so I relied heavily on stock transitions which come with the software (e.g. the globe trotting transition from iMovie 11).  I did however tweak bits here and there to put my own personal touch on it.\n\nThe overall aim of this Step is to add music and align the video to the music with the goal of timing the entire video to the beat of the music.  Also a goal is to slow down important bits, especially showing the important/nice photos for a bit longer time e.g. 1/5-1/3 of a second (remembering the video at Step 2 was at 12 fps which is 1/12 of a second being extremely fast).  I think any photo showing for longer than 1/2 a second loses the feeling of a photo in motion video and turns into more of a  photo slideshow feel.  However, you should experiment, who knows what gold can be dug up!\n\nMy main aim was to get a good photo transition on the beats and also to vary the timing of the video leading up to a main beats.  For example, I used Final Cut's \"step up\" and \"step down\" features a lot to have a sequence gradually slow down or speed up leading to a beat.\n\nThe majority of the time spent here will be figuring out how to get the music to align and working out a good intro and outro (the core of the video will be the photo slideshow).  You can drop in videos, text, photos etc to break things up a bit as well.  I found the easiest way to line up the video and music was to use something with a fast beat...it added a lot to the mood of the video and made everything seem to be on beat a lot more (even though a lot of it isn't still hehe).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere was quite a lot I learned from this:  Video editing is a LOT of work, takes up a lot of hard drive space and requires some hardcore computing hardware.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun making it given it was mainly very experimental and I learned quite a bit about video editing.\n\nI am a terrible writer so a lot of this post probably doesn't make sense, please let me know if anything needs clarification.\n\n[1]:\t/2011/08/23/New-Zealand-trip-2009-video/\n[2]:\thttp://www.apple.com/quicktime/what-is/","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2011-09-01-Making-of-New-Zealand-2009-Trip-video---photos-in-motion/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 01, 2011","title":"Making of :: New Zealand 2009 Trip video -

Raw artistry, is put out into the world. Feedback and collaboration result. Fans and friends help support the making of this art. **Great work gets made and shared, and the recipe of how it was all pulled off is given back to the world for consumption, edification, and repetition.**\"\n\nThat last part is an ideology that I only learned about in the last 6 month and something I am starting to really believe in.\n\nIn my context, Trey Ratcliff has put together a video in quite a creative way, he has been kind enough to make a how-to video which has in turn allowed me to make my version.  I have tweaked it a little bit and will pass on how I did it.\n\nThis is an example of how the internet is democratising content and knowledge and ultimately encouraging creativity.  An innately non-creative person like me can now find great quality resources for free and learn to be creative.\n\nExciting times ahead.\n\n[1]:\thttp://www.stuckincustoms.com/\n[2]:\thttp://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/2011/07/new-start-to-finish-evolution-of-a-music-video-project/","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2011-08-23-New-Zealand-trip-2009-video/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 23, 2011","title":"New Zealand trip 2009 video","description":null}},{"excerpt":"Can’t say Australians aren’t serious!

In most cases, this is what makes the best images.\n\n---- \n\nI was asked by a friend to turn the photo below into black and white and that the point of the photo was to emphasise the size of the fjord by using the boat as a term of reference and comparison. I think the original picture does that quite well.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2011/02/p4023089_orig.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Original</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nWell, I did just that.  A simple B/W conversion using the channel mixer adjustment in Photoshop by emphasising the red colours for the monochrome conversion to keep the details.  Done.  Happy result.\n\nHowever, I felt the image could be further improved.  I did some levels/curves to bring out some details in the clouds and to increase the overall contrast slightly.  I then removed the second boat which I felt was distracting and did a slight straighten adjustment.   The image below is what I came up with.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2011/02/p4023089_red-bw-v2.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Better</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\nHowever, looking at the original image, I didn't think B/W was necessarily the best thing.  I felt colour was still better.  The fog had robbed the original picture of some of this, so my aim was to bring it back.  I did some small saturation adjustment to the colours, especially the blues.  Then I did a gaussian blur layer and a overlay blend mode with a 30% opacity setting to give the colours a bit more pop.  Below is the result.\n\n<p>\n    <figure>\n        <img src=\"/images/2011/02/p4023089_colour-copy.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Creative</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</p>\n\n---- \n\nBy no means do I think the image itself is a shining example of creativity.  After all, I didn't even take it!  What is important is that, by experimenting and not being afraid to do so, with a clear mind, the outcome will be have a bigger change of being creative.  It's the process that's important.\n\nThere will be thousands of mistakes before I hit on a winning image, but to not be afraid to experiment and to learn from the thousands of failures, the end result will be the ability to make creative pictures.\n\nA lot of great photographers always say: don't  just take pictures, make pictures.  I think the only difference between the two is creativity.\n\n[1]:\thttp://www.chasejarvis.com/\n[2]:\thttp://jeremycowart.com/\n[3]:\t/images/2011/02/p4023089_orig.jpg\n[4]:\t/images/2011/02/p4023089_red-bw-v2.jpg\n[5]:\t/images/2011/02/p4023089_colour-copy.jpg\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2011/02/p4023089_orig.jpg\n[image-2]:\t/images/2011/02/p4023089_red-bw-v2.jpg\n[image-3]:\t/images/2011/02/p4023089_colour-copy.jpg","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2011-02-21-Post-processing-and-creative-process/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 21, 2011","title":"Post processing and creative process","description":null}},{"excerpt":"I’ve been watching a lot of tutorials these past few weeks.

Really slowed down the process as I always had to do multiple test shots.  I hear the pros saying it's almos second nature for them to be able to pick out the f-stop and shutter speed given a particular scene.  Something to strive towards.\n\n50mm lens on a crop sensor body is really not cool when you have the ability get close to the subject and not much room to move (given other people and car displays don't allow you to step back).  Come to think about it, a wide angle or even fisheye lens would have allowed much more creative pictures.  Then again, the 50mm lens meant that it was hard to get complete pictures of the cars as standing too far back would encourage people to walk in front of you, so the result was I was forced to choose to focus on the most interesting part of the cars.\n\n![][image-1]\n\nI chose to use black and white in the picture above because the car was white and the background colour just distracted from the car (lime green Lamborghini in particular).  The edge sharpening tool was really useful as it brought out the details in the wheels and other bold lines.  I'm pretty happy with it.  Although, I wonder if increasing the contrast and decreasing the brightness would make the image \"pop\" that little more.  I don't know if losing some of the finer details would be worth it though.\n\nAnother thing I would note is that, in the same way portraiture photography should focus on the eyes, car photography should focus on the things that defines the car.  In the image above, given the shallow depth of field, I would change it by making the three chrome-ringed air vents the main focus rather than the wing mirror.  However, would that give too much blur in the extreme foreground of the picture?  That might be a desirable effect as it draws the eye naturally to the focus even more than it does as it is now.\n\nNo cropping required though!

Just some thoughts from the day:\n\nI completely agree with the notion that practice is everything as every time I take some photos I learn a great deal.\n\nDuring a simple stroll around Manly at sunset, I learnt a lot about how using different exposures can help capture colours.   Along with this, the importance of manual mode when the camera's metering system fails and using the correct  focus points.  I was able to capture the colours in the images below without any post processing adjustments.\n\nI also noticed that I think a lot more about what i want to capture now and not just snapping randomly.\n\n![][image-1]\n\nThe image above shows that if I speed the shutter speed up, I can cut out enough of the bright light so the subtle colours can come through better.\n\nThe images below show that, as always with photography, there is a trade-off as to what else you want to capture and how well exposed they are.\n\n![][image-2]\n\nThe photo above could have had the buildings blacked out even more, with more of a silhouette look, given the details in them are really not important.\n\n![][image-3]\n\nAs opposed to the image above, where the colour of the sky and rock pool come out well but I wouldn't mind slightly more detail in some of the other areas as I think the overall image looks a little too dark.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try any polarising or other colour adjustments with the photos I captured, but I feel they might add something, but I'm not quite sure what else I want to add.\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2010/10/img_0897-2010-07-17-at-17-04-44.jpg\n[image-2]:\t/images/2010/10/img_0894-2010-07-17-at-16-59-01.jpg\n[image-3]:\t/images/2010/10/img_0905-2010-07-17-at-17-08-40.jpg","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2010-10-25-Manly-17-July-2010/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 25, 2010","title":"Manly 17 July 2010","description":null}},{"excerpt":"I went to a friend’s engagement ceremony…a long while ago…somewhere around July 2010.  I guess I have not been keeping this updated as…","body":"\nI went to a friend's engagement ceremony...a long while ago...somewhere around July 2010.  I guess I have not been keeping this updated as frequently as I would like!\n\nFrom memory, I went into this event with only a basic understanding of the different elements of exposure, and some random rules about composition.  My aim was to take some \ngreat photos with creative use of depth of field as I felt I understood the concept best (out of all the other concepts I knew little about) and wanted to test out how different aperture settings affected the picture.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n1.  I can imagine how hard a wedding/event photographer has to work.  I have no idea why some people would consider it to be the thing you do when you fail at all else.   I can now appreciate the enormous amount of skill to capture some of the relaxed/natural style wedding photos I love to see.\n\n\tIt's really important not to be lazy when photographing at events.  It is so hard to get a good shot and most of the time it requires you to get really close up to the action.  I didn't really appreciate how many people can stand up and fill in what I thought was a small space between me and the subject!\n\n2.  Indoor lighting is not easy.  It's really important to understand the dynamics of light.  I had no idea how bad the camera sees in light I would find quite normal.\n\n\tI tried taking the lazy route and did some shots at 800 ISO - thinking it would compensate for my fast shutter speed so I wouldn't have to use a tripod.  My SLR is much better a camera than I am a photographer, but it just does not produce the best images under poor light at high ISOs.  The noise in the images was terrible!\n\n\tI did not use any flash, because I must admit, I was afraid of it!  I knew that using fill flash was the key, but I didn't really understand it all that well.  Being afraid of getting the terrible \"snapshot\" look, I opted instead to use a wide aperture.  Luckily, this suited the portraiture style of most shots.\n\n3. I love the 50mm f/1.8!  This really is the must have lens for any beginner SLR shooter.  It's cheap for one, but most importantly, the fast aperture really allows experimentation with depth of field and the fixed focal length forces moving and not being lazy (good and bad).\n\n4. I love the spur of the moment shots.  It really creates the best memories.  When the subject is relaxed, it just creates a much better atmosphere.  The awkwardness of a forced pose just doesn't cut it anymore.\n\n5. Pray and spray!  This definitely holds true.  Luck is a factor.  I've discovered that shooting 100 or so photos, you will have around 10-20 decent ones.   You will always manage to get a good shot if you're lucky. I think my most immediate goal is the need to minimise the amount of bad shots.  Each picture should be deliberately taken and every element should be explainable.\n\n6. This was the first time I solely used RAW.  I learnt that it requires so much more work in post processing compared to JPEG.  Luckily post processing is something I  really enjoy.  I like how the image creating process is two staged.  You get caught up in the moment to take the pictures which can be all hustle and bustle; but then you get to sit down, review, reflect and think during the post processing stage of it.  Although, it definitely hinders turnaround times.\n\nI also learnt the importance of applying sharpening to RAW files....and noise reduction.  I think it's extremely important to master both these techniques in understanding how they interact with other adjustments.\n\nI think the picture below perfectly highlights points 5 and 6.  This is a picture that started off not that great amongst a sea of pretty terrible ones.  With some extreme cropping, colour adjustments, etc, I was able to make a half-decent picture.\n\n![][image-1]\n\nAll in all, I am quite pleased with how much I was able to learn and put into practice.\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2010/10/img_0767-2010-07-04-at-12-43-05.jpg","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2010-10-18-Event/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 18, 2010","title":"Event","description":null}},{"excerpt":"First experimentation with HDR.  Nothing special.  I still don’t really understand everything.","body":"\nFirst experimentation with HDR.  Nothing special.  I still don't really understand everything.\n\n![][image-1]\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2010/07/img_0680-2_hdr2-2010-06-19-at-20-48-05.jpg","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2010-07-07-HDR-first/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 07, 2010","title":"HDR first","description":null}},{"excerpt":"Winter again.  Really getting cold now.","body":"\nWinter again.  Really getting cold now.\n\n![][image-1]\n\n[image-1]:\t/images/2010/06/dsc01050-2009-06-26-at-12-01-51.jpg","fields":{"source":"blog","slug":"/2010-06-17-Snows/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"June 17, 2010","title":"Snows","description":null}},{"excerpt":"The new iPhone came out today and I have to say I’m looking forward to the new OS!
