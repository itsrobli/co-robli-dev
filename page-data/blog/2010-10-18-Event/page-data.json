I think my most immediate goal is the need to minimise the amount of bad shots.  Each picture should be deliberately taken and every element should be explainable.</li>\n<li>This was the first time I solely used RAW.  I learnt that it requires so much more work in post processing compared to JPEG.  Luckily post processing is something I  really enjoy.  I like how the image creating process is two staged.  You get caught up in the moment to take the pictures which can be all hustle and bustle; but then you get to sit down, review, reflect and think during the post processing stage of it.  Although, it definitely hinders turnaround times.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also learnt the importance of applying sharpening to RAW files…and noise reduction.  I think it’s extremely important to master both these techniques in understanding how they interact with other adjustments.</p>\n<p>I think the picture below perfectly highlights points 5 and 6.  This is a picture that started off not that great amongst a sea of pretty terrible ones.  With some extreme cropping, colour adjustments, etc, I was able to make a half-decent picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/co-robli-dev/images/2010/10/img_0767-2010-07-04-at-12-43-05.jpg\"></p>\n<p>All in all, I am quite pleased with how much I was able to learn and put into practice.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Event","date":"October 18, 2010","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-10-25-Manly-17-July-2010/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Manly 17 July 2010"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-07-07-HDR-first/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"HDR first"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c3a5e26c-013e-5be4-8242-57308e768b04","previousPostId":"fe0767e6-5eed-510f-91a2-ec3afe52117e","nextPostId":"2bfcb1ef-837e-529c-9b17-dc60b44ef77c"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
