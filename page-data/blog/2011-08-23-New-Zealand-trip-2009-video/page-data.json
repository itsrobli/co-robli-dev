Raw artistry, is put out into the world. Feedback and collaboration result. Fans and friends help support the making of this art. <strong>Great work gets made and shared, and the recipe of how it was all pulled off is given back to the world for consumption, edification, and repetition.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That last part is an ideology that I only learned about in the last 6 month and something I am starting to really believe in.</p>\n<p>In my context, Trey Ratcliff has put together a video in quite a creative way, he has been kind enough to make a how-to video which has in turn allowed me to make my version.  I have tweaked it a little bit and will pass on how I did it.</p>\n<p>This is an example of how the internet is democratising content and knowledge and ultimately encouraging creativity.  An innately non-creative person like me can now find great quality resources for free and learn to be creative.</p>\n<p>Exciting times ahead.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Zealand trip 2009 video","date":"August 23, 2011","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-09-01-Making-of-New-Zealand-2009-Trip-video---photos-in-motion/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making of :: New Zealand 2009 Trip video - photos in motion"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2011-08-03-Winter-surfing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Winter surfing"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7f523ee9-9bec-5043-acf1-b7d3f6f53660","previousPostId":"c0eb39f7-eea5-5b72-bd03-a55ac9e94f02","nextPostId":"7ea967c8-ab3e-593e-b5aa-09d27f85c6ac"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
